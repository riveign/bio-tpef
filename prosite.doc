* N-glycosylation site *
************************

It has been known for a long time [1] that potential N-glycosylation sites are
specific to the consensus sequence Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr.  It must be noted that the
presence of the consensus  tripeptide  is  not sufficient  to conclude that an
asparagine residue is glycosylated, due to  the fact that the  folding of  the
protein plays an important  role in the  regulation of N-glycosylation [2]. It
has been shown [3] that  the  presence of proline between Asn and Ser/Thr will
inhibit N-glycosylation; this  has  been confirmed by a recent [4] statistical
analysis of glycosylation sites, which also  shows that about 50% of the sites
that have a proline C-terminal to Ser/Thr are not glycosylated.

It must also  be noted that there  are  a few  reported cases of glycosylation
sites with the pattern Asn-Xaa-Cys; an  experimentally demonstrated occurrence
of such a non-standard site is found in the plasma protein C [5].

* cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation site *
****************************************************************

There has been a  number of studies  relative to the  specificity of cAMP- and
cGMP-dependent protein kinases [1,2,3].  Both types of kinases appear to share
a preference  for  the  phosphorylation  of serine or threonine residues found
close to at least  two consecutive N-terminal  basic residues. It is important
to note that there are quite a number of exceptions to this rule.

In vivo, protein kinase C  exhibits  a  preference  for the phosphorylation of
serine or  threonine residues found close to a C-terminal basic residue [1,2].
The presence  of  additional   basic residues at the  N- or C-terminal of  the
target amino acid enhances the Vmax and Km of the phosphorylation reaction.

* Casein kinase II phosphorylation site *
*****************************************

Casein kinase II (CK-2) is a protein serine/threonine kinase whose activity is
independent of  cyclic  nucleotides   and  calcium.  CK-2  phosphorylates many
different proteins.   The  substrate  specificity [1]  of  this  enzyme can be
summarized as follows:

 (1) Under comparable conditions Ser is favored over Thr.
 (2) An acidic residue (either Asp or Glu) must be present three residues from
     the C-terminal of the phosphate acceptor site.
 (3) Additional acidic  residues in  positions +1, +2, +4, and +5 increase the
     phosphorylation rate.  Most  physiological  substrates  have at least one
     acidic residue in these positions.
 (4) Asp is preferred to Glu as the provider of acidic determinants.
 (5) A basic residue at the N-terminal  of the  acceptor  site  decreases  the
     phosphorylation rate, while an acidic one will increase it.

-Consensus pattern: [ST]-x(2)-[DE]
                    [S or T is the phosphorylation site]

-Note: This pattern is found in most of the known physiological substrates.

Substrates of tyrosine protein kinases are generally characterized by a lysine
or an arginine seven residues  to  the N-terminal side  of  the phosphorylated
tyrosine.  An acidic residue (Asp  or Glu) is often  found at either  three or
four residues to  the N-terminal side  of  the tyrosine  [1,2,3].  There are a
number of exceptions to  this rule such as the  tyrosine phosphorylation sites
of enolase and lipocortin II.

* N-myristoylation site *
*************************

An  appreciable  number of eukaryotic  proteins  are  acylated by the covalent
addition of myristate (a C14-saturated fatty acid) to their N-terminal residue
via an amide linkage [1,2]. The sequence specificity of the enzyme responsible
for this  modification,   myristoyl CoA:protein N-myristoyl transferase (NMT),
has been  derived from the sequence of known N-myristoylated proteins and from
studies using synthetic peptides. It seems to be the following:

 - The N-terminal residue must be glycine.
 - In position 2, uncharged residues  are allowed.  Charged residues,  proline
   and large hydrophobic residues are not allowed.
 - In positions 3 and 4, most, if not all, residues are allowed.
 - In position  5,  small uncharged  residues are allowed (Ala, Ser, Thr, Cys,
   Asn and Gly). Serine is favored.
 - In position 6, proline is not allowed.

-Consensus pattern: G-{EDRKHPFYW}-x(2)-[STAGCN]-{P}
                    [G is the N-myristoylation site]

-Note: We  deliberately include as  potential myristoylated  glycine residues,
 those which  are  internal  to a sequence. It could well be that the sequence
 under study  represents  a  viral  polyprotein  precursor and that subsequent
 proteolytic processing  could expose an internal glycine as the N-terminal of
 a mature protein.

The precursor of  hormones  and other active  peptides  which are C-terminally

the amide group, and  most often by at  least two  consecutive  basic residues
(Arg or Lys) which generally function as an active peptide  precursor cleavage
site.  Although all amino acids can be amidated,  neutral hydrophobic residues
such as Val or Phe are good substrates, while  charged residues such as Asp or
Arg  are much less reactive.  C-terminal  amidation has not  yet been shown to
occur in unicellular organisms or in plants.

* Gamma-carboxyglutamic acid-rich (Gla) domain signature and profile *
**********************************************************************

The  vitamin  K-dependent  blood  coagulation  factor  IX  as  well as several
extracellular  regulatory proteins require vitamin K for the posttranslational
synthesis  of  gamma-carboxyglutamic  acid,  an  amino  acid  clustered in the
N-terminal  Gla  domain  of these proteins [1,2]. The Gla domain is a membrane
binding  motif  which,  in  the  presence  of  calcium  ions,  interacts  with
phospholipid membranes that include phosphatidylserine.

The  3D  structure  of  the  Gla  domain  has  been  solved  (see  for example
<PDB:1CFH>)  [3,4].  Calcium  ions  induce  conformational  changes in the Gla
domain  and  are  necessary  for  the  Gla  domain  to fold properly. A common
structural  feature  of functional Gla domains is the clustering of N-terminal
hydrophobic  residues  into a hydrophobic patch that mediates interaction with
the cell surface membrane [4].

Proteins known to contain a Gla domain are listed below:

 - A number of plasma proteins involved in blood coagulation.   These proteins
   are prothrombin, coagulation factors VII, IX and X, proteins C, S, and Z.
 - Two proteins that  occur  in calcified tissues:  osteocalcin (also known as
   bone-Gla protein, BGP), and matrix Gla-protein (MGP).
 - Proline-rich Gla proteins 1 and 2 [5].
 - Cone snail venom peptides: conantokin-G and -T, and conotoxin GS [6].

The  pattern  we  developed  start with the conserved Gla-x(3)-Gla-x-Cys motif
found  in  the  middle of the domain which seems to be important for substrate
recognition by the carboxylase [7] and end with the last conserved position of
the  domain (an aromatic residue). We also developed a profile that covers the
whole Gla domain.

* Phosphopantetheine attachment site *
**************************************

Phosphopantetheine (or pantetheine 4' phosphate) is  the  prosthetic  group of
acyl carrier proteins (ACP) in some  multienzyme complexes  where it serves as
a 'swinging  arm'  for  the  attachment of activated fatty acid and amino-acid
groups [1].  Phosphopantetheine  is  attached  to  a  serine  residue in these
proteins [2].  ACP  proteins  or   domains  have  been found in various enzyme
systems which  are  listed  below  (references  are only provided for recently
determined sequences).

 - Fatty  acid  synthase  (FAS),  which  catalyzes the formation of long-chain
   fatty acids  from  acetyl-CoA,  malonyl-CoA  and NADPH. Bacterial and plant
   chloroplast FAS are composed of eight separate subunits which correspond to
   the  different  enzymatic  activities;  ACP  is  one of these polypeptides.
   Fungal FAS consists of two multifunctional proteins, FAS1 and FAS2; the ACP
   domain is  located  in  the  N-terminal  section  of  FAS2.  Vertebrate FAS
   consists of a single  multifunctional  enzyme;  the ACP  domain  is located
   between the beta-ketoacyl reductase  domain and the C-terminal thioesterase
   domain [3].
 - Polyketide antibiotics  synthase enzyme systems.  Polyketides are secondary
   metabolites produced from simple fatty acids, by microorganisms and plants.
   ACP is one of the polypeptidic  components  involved in the biosynthesis of
   Streptomyces polyketide  antibiotics  actinorhodin,  curamycin, granatacin,
   monensin, oxytetracycline and tetracenomycin C.
 - Bacillus  subtilis  putative polyketide synthases pksK, pksL and pksM which
   respectively contain three, five and one ACP domains.
 - The multifunctional 6-methysalicylic acid synthase (MSAS) from  Penicillium
   patulum. This is a multifunctional enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of a
   polyketide antibiotic  and  which  contains an ACP domain in the C-terminal
   extremity.
 - Multifunctional  mycocerosic  acid  synthase  (gene mas) from Mycobacterium
   bovis.
 - Gramicidin  S  synthase  I  (gene  grsA)  from Bacillus brevis. This enzyme
   catalyzes the  first  step  in  the  biosynthesis  of the cyclic antibiotic
   gramicidin S.
 - Tyrocidine  synthase  I  (gene  tycA)  from  Bacillus  brevis. The reaction
   carried out by tycA is identical to that catalyzed by grsA.
 - Gramicidin S synthase II (gene grsB) from Bacillus brevis. This enzyme is a
   multifunctional protein  that  activates  and  polymerizes proline, valine,
   ornithine and leucine. GrsB contains four ACP domains.
 - Erythronolide synthase proteins 1, 2 and 3 from Saccharopolyspora erythraea
   which is   involved  in  the  biosynthesis  of  the  polyketide  antibiotic
   erythromicin. Each of these proteins contain two ACP domains.
 - Conidial green pigment synthase from Aspergillus nidulans.
 - ACV  synthase  from  various fungi. This enzyme catalyzes the first step in
   the biosynthesis  of  penicillin  and  cephalosporin. It contains three ACP
   domains.
 - Enterobactin  synthase  component F (gene entF) from Escherichia coli. This
   enzyme is  involved  in  the  ATP-dependent  activation  of  serine  during
   enterobactin (enterochelin) biosynthesis.
 - Cyclic  peptide  antibiotic  surfactin  synthase  subunits  1, 2 and 3 from
   Bacillus subtilis.  Subunits  1  and 2 contains three related domains while
   subunit 3 only contains a single domain.
 - HC-toxin  synthase  (gene  HTS1)  from  Cochliobolus  carbonum. This enzyme

* Prokaryotic membrane lipoprotein lipid attachment site profile *
******************************************************************

In prokaryotes, membrane lipoproteins are synthesized  with a precursor signal
peptide, which is cleaved  by  a specific lipoprotein signal peptidase (signal
peptidase II). The peptidase recognizes a conserved sequence and cuts upstream
of a cysteine residue  to which a  glyceride-fatty acid lipid is attached [1].
Some of  the  proteins known to undergo such processing currently include (for
recent listings see [1,2,3]):

 - Major outer membrane lipoprotein (murein-lipoproteins) (gene lpp).
 - Escherichia coli lipoprotein-28 (gene nlpA).
 - Escherichia coli lipoprotein-34 (gene nlpB).
 - Escherichia coli lipoprotein nlpC.
 - Escherichia coli lipoprotein nlpD.
 - Escherichia coli osmotically inducible lipoprotein B (gene osmB).
 - Escherichia coli osmotically inducible lipoprotein E (gene osmE).
 - Escherichia coli peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein (gene pal).
 - Escherichia coli rare lipoproteins A and B (genes rplA and rplB).
 - Escherichia coli copper homeostasis protein cutF (or nlpE).
 - Escherichia coli plasmids traT proteins.
 - Escherichia coli Col plasmids lysis proteins.
 - A number of Bacillus beta-lactamases.
 - Bacillus subtilis periplasmic oligopeptide-binding protein (gene oppA).
 - Borrelia burgdorferi outer surface proteins A and B (genes ospA and ospB).

From  the precursor sequences of all these proteins, we derived a profile that
starts   at   the   beginning   of   the   sequence   and   ends   after   the

* Endoplasmic reticulum targeting sequence *
********************************************

Proteins  that permanently reside in the  lumen  of  the endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) seem to be distinguished from newly synthesized secretory proteins by the
presence of  the C-terminal  sequence Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu (KDEL) [1,2]. While KDEL
is the preferred signal in many species, variants  of  that signal are used by
different species. This situation is described in the following table.

   Signal   Species
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   KDEL     Vertebrates, Drosophila, Caenorhabditis elegans, plants
   HDEL     Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Kluyveromyces lactis, plants
   DDEL     Kluyveromyces lactis
   ADEL     Schizosaccharomyces pombe (fission yeast)
   SDEL     Plasmodium falciparum

The signal is usually very  strictly  conserved in  major ER proteins but some
minor ER  proteins  have   divergent  sequences  (probably  because  efficient
retention of these proteins is not crucial to the cell).

Proteins bearing the KDEL-type signal are  not simply held in the ER,  but are
selectively retrieved from a post-ER compartment by a receptor and returned to
their normal location.

The currently known ER luminal proteins are listed below.

 - Protein  disulfide-isomerase  (PDI)   (also  known  as  the beta-subunit of
   prolyl 4-hydroxylase, as  a  component  of  oligosaccharyl  transferase, as
   glutathione-insulin  transhydrogenase  and  as  a  thyroid  hormone binding
   protein).
 - ERp60, ERp72, and P5, three minor isoforms of PDI.
 - Trypanosoma brucei bloodstream-specific protein 2, a probable PDI.
 - hsp70  related  protein GRP78 (also known as the immunoglobulin heavy chain
   binding protein (BiP), and as KAR2, in fungi).
 - hsp90 related protein 'endoplasmin' (also known as GRP94, Erp99 or Hsp108).
 - Calreticulin, a  calcium-binding protein (also  known as calregulin, CRP55,
   or HACBP).
 - ERC-55, a calcium-binding protein.
 - Reticulocalbin, a calcium-binding protein.
 - Hsp47, a heat-shock protein that  binds  strongly to collagen and could act
   as a chaperone in the collagen biosynthetic pathway.
 - A receptor for a plant hormone, auxin.
 - Thiol proteases from rice bean (SH-EP) and kidney bean (EP-C1).
 - Esterases from mammalian liver and from nematodes.
 - Alpha-2-macroglobulin receptor-associated protein (RAP).
 - Yeast peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase D (CYPD).
 - Yeast protein KRE5, a protein required for (1->6)-beta-D-glucan synthesis.
 - Yeast  protein  SEC20,  required    for  the transport of proteins from the
   endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus.
 - Yeast protein SCJ1, involved in protein sorting.

-Consensus pattern: [KRHQSA]-[DENQ]-E-L>
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for liver esterases which have H-[TVI]-E-L.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 24 proteins which  are  clearly not
 located in  the  ER  (because  they  are  of  bacterial  or viral origin, for
 example) and a protein which can be considered as valid candidate: human 80K-
 H protein.

* Bipartite nuclear localization signal profile *
*************************************************

The uptake  of protein by  the   nucleus  is extremely selective   and nuclear
proteins must therefore  contain within  their final  structure a signal  that
specifies selective accumulation in the nucleus [1,2]. Studies on some nuclear
proteins, such as  the  large T antigen of SV40,  have indicated which part of
the sequence  is  required  for  nuclear  translocation.   The  known  nuclear
targeting sequences  are   generally  basic, but  there  seems to  be no clear
common denominator  between  all the known sequences.  Although some consensus
sequence patterns have  been proposed (see for example [3]),  the current best
strategy to detect a nuclear targeting sequence is based [4] on  the following
definition of what is called a 'bipartite nuclear localization signal':

  (1) Two adjacent basic amino acids (Arg or Lys).
  (2) A spacer region of any 10 residues.
  (3) At least three basic residues (Arg or Lys) in the five positions
      after the spacer region.

The  profile  we  developed  covers  the entire bipartite nuclear localization
signal.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: 56% of known
 nuclear proteins according to [4].
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: about 4.2% of  non-nuclear proteins
 according to [4].

-Note:  This profile replace an obsolete rule. All the information in the rule

*****************************************
* ATP/GTP-binding site motif A (P-loop) *
*****************************************

From sequence comparisons and crystallographic data analysis it has been shown
[1,2,3,4,5,6] that an appreciable proportion of proteins that  bind ATP or GTP
share a number of more or less conserved sequence motifs.   The best conserved
of these  motifs  is  a  glycine-rich region, which typically forms a flexible
loop between a beta-strand and an alpha-helix. This loop interacts with one of
the phosphate  groups  of  the  nucleotide.   This sequence motif is generally
referred to as the 'A' consensus sequence [1] or the 'P-loop' [5].

There are numerous ATP- or GTP-binding proteins  in which the P-loop is found.
We list below  a number of protein  families  for  which  the relevance of the
presence of such motif has been noted:

 - ATP synthase alpha and beta subunits (see <PDOC00137>).
 - Myosin heavy chains.
 - Kinesin heavy chains and kinesin-like proteins (see <PDOC00343>).
 - Dynamins and dynamin-like proteins (see <PDOC00362>).
 - Guanylate kinase (see <PDOC00670>).
 - Thymidine kinase (see <PDOC00524>).
 - Thymidylate kinase (see <PDOC01034>).
 - Shikimate kinase (see <PDOC00868>).
 - Nitrogenase iron protein family (nifH/chlL) (see <PDOC00580>).
 - ATP-binding proteins involved  in 'active transport' (ABC transporters) [7]
   (see <PDOC00185>).
 - DNA and RNA helicases [8,9,10].
 - GTP-binding elongation factors (EF-Tu, EF-1alpha, EF-G, EF-2, etc.).
 - Ras family of GTP-binding proteins (Ras, Rho, Rab, Ral, Ypt1, SEC4, etc.).
 - Nuclear protein ran (see <PDOC00859>).
 - ADP-ribosylation factors family (see <PDOC00781>).
 - Bacterial dnaA protein (see <PDOC00771>).
 - Bacterial recA protein (see <PDOC00131>).
 - Bacterial recF protein (see <PDOC00539>).
 - Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins alpha subunits (Gi, Gs, Gt, G0, etc.).
 - DNA mismatch repair proteins mutS family (See <PDOC00388>).
 - Bacterial type II secretion system protein E (see <PDOC00567>).

Not all ATP- or GTP-binding proteins are picked-up by this motif.  A number of
proteins escape detection because the structure   of their ATP-binding site is
completely different from that of the P-loop.  Examples  of  such proteins are
the E1-E2 ATPases or  the  glycolytic kinases.   In  other ATP- or GTP-binding
proteins the flexible loop exists  in a  slightly different form; this is  the
case for tubulins or protein kinases.  A special mention must  be reserved for
adenylate  kinase,  in  which  there  is a  single  deviation  from the P-loop
pattern: in the last position Gly is found instead of Ser or Thr.

-Consensus pattern: [AG]-x(4)-G-K-[ST]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: a majority.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: in addition to the proteins  listed
 above,  the 'A' motif is also  found in a number  of other proteins.  Most of
 these proteins  probably  bind  a nucleotide, but others are definitively not
 ATP- or GTP-binding (as for example  chymotrypsin,  or  human  ferritin light
 chain).

* EF-hand calcium-binding domain signature and profile *
********************************************************

Many calcium-binding proteins belong to the same evolutionary family and share
a  type  of calcium-binding domain known as the EF-hand [1 to 5]. This type of
domain  consists  of  a  twelve  residue loop flanked on both side by a twelve
residue  alpha-helical domain (see <PDB:1CLL>). In an EF-hand loop the calcium
ion is coordinated in a pentagonal bipyramidal configuration. The six residues
involved  in the binding are in positions 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 12; these residues
are denoted by X, Y, Z, -Y, -X and -Z. The invariant Glu or Asp at position 12
provides   two   oxygens  for  liganding  Ca  (bidentate  ligand).  The  basic
structural/functional  unit  of  EF-hand proteins is usually a pair of EF-hand
motifs  that  together  form a stable four-helix bundle domain. The pairing of
EF-hand enables cooperativity in the binding of Ca2+ ions.

We list below the proteins  which  are  known to contain EF-hand  regions. For
each type of protein we have indicated between parenthesis the total number of
EF-hand regions known or supposed to exist.   This  number  does  not  include
regions which  clearly  have  lost  their  calcium-binding  properties, or the
atypical low-affinity site (which spans thirteen residues) found in the S-100/
ICaBP family of proteins [6].

 - Aequorin and Renilla luciferin binding protein (LBP) (Ca=3).
 - Alpha actinin (Ca=2).
 - Calbindin (Ca=4).
 - Calcineurin B subunit (protein phosphatase 2B regulatory subunit) (Ca=4).

 - Diacylglycerol kinase (EC 2.7.1.107) (DGK) (Ca=2).
 - FAD-dependent   glycerol-3-phosphate   dehydrogenase   (EC  1.1.99.5)  from
   mammals (Ca=1).
 - Fimbrin (plastin) (Ca=2).
 - Flagellar calcium-binding protein (1f8) from Trypanosoma cruzi (Ca=1 or 2).
 - Guanylate cyclase activating protein (GCAP) (Ca=3).
 - Inositol phospholipid-specific phospholipase C isozymes gamma-1 and delta-1
   (Ca=2) [10].
 - Intestinal calcium-binding protein (ICaBPs) (Ca=2).
 - MIF related proteins 8 (MRP-8 or CFAG) and 14 (MRP-14) (Ca=2).
 - Myosin regulatory light chains (Ca=1).
 - Oncomodulin (Ca=2).
 - Osteonectin  (basement  membrane  protein  BM-40) (SPARC) and proteins that
   contains an  'osteonectin'  domain  (QR1, matrix glycoprotein SC1) (see the
   entry <PDOC00535>) (Ca=1).
 - Parvalbumins alpha and beta (Ca=2).
 - Placental  calcium-binding  protein  (18a2)  (nerve  growth  factor induced
   protein 42a) (p9k) (Ca=2).
 - Recoverins (visinin, hippocalcin, neurocalcin, S-modulin) (Ca=2 to 3).
 - Reticulocalbin (Ca=4).
 - S-100 protein, alpha and beta chains (Ca=2).
 - Sarcoplasmic calcium-binding protein (SCPs) (Ca=2 to 3).
 - Sea urchin proteins Spec 1 (Ca=4), Spec 2 (Ca=4?), Lps-1 (Ca=8).
 - Serine/threonine  specific  protein  phosphatase  rdgc  (EC 3.1.3.16)  from
   Drosophila (Ca=2).
 - Sorcin V19 from hamster (Ca=2).
 - Spectrin alpha chain (Ca=2).
 - Squidulin (optic lobe calcium-binding protein) from squid (Ca=4).
 - Troponins C; from  skeletal muscle (Ca=4), from cardiac muscle (Ca=3), from
   arthropods and molluscs (Ca=2).

There has been a number of attempts [7,8] to develop patterns that pick-up EF-
hand  regions,  but  these  studies were made a few years ago when not so many
different  families  of  calcium-binding  proteins  were  known.  We therefore
developed a new pattern which takes into account all published sequences. This
pattern  includes the complete EF-hand loop as well as the first residue which
follows  the loop and which seem to always be hydrophobic. We also developed a
profile that covers the loop and the two alpha helices.

-Consensus pattern: D-{W}-[DNS]-{ILVFYW}-[DENSTG]-[DNQGHRK]-{GP}-[LIVMC]-
                    [DENQSTAGC]-x(2)-[DE]-[LIVMFYW]

-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
 probably not calcium-binding  and  a few proteins for which we have reason to
 believe that  they bind  calcium:  a number  of endoglucanases and a xylanase
 from the  cellulosome complex of Clostridium [9].

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: Positions 1 (X), 3 (Y) and 12 (-Z) are the most conserved.
-Note: The 6th residue in an EF-hand loop is, in most  cases a  Gly,  but  the
 number of exceptions to this 'rule' has gradually increased and we felt  that
 the pattern should include all the  different  residues which have been shown
 to exist in this position in functional Ca-binding sites.
-Note: The pattern will, in some cases,  miss  one  of  the EF-hand regions in
 some proteins with multiple EF-hand domains.

* Actinin-type actin-binding domain signatures *
************************************************

Alpha-actinin is  a F-actin cross-linking  protein  which is thought to anchor
actin to a variety of intracellular structures [1].   The actin-binding domain
of alpha-actinin seems to reside in the first  250 residues of the protein.  A
similar actin-binding domain has  been  found in the N-terminal region of many
different actin-binding proteins [2,3]:

 - In the beta chain of spectrin (or fodrin).
 - In dystrophin, the protein defective  in  Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)
   and which  may  play a  role  in  anchoring the  cytoskeleton to the plasma
   membrane.
 - In the slime mold gelation factor (or ABP-120).
 - In actin-binding protein ABP-280  (or filamin), a  protein  that link actin
   filaments to membrane glycoproteins.
 - In fimbrin (or plastin),  an actin-bundling protein.  Fimbrin  differs from
   the above proteins in  that  it  contains  two  tandem copies of the actin-
   binding domain and that these copies are located  in the C-terminal part of
   the protein.

We selected  two  conserved  regions  as  signature  patterns for this type of
domain.  The first of this region  is located at  the beginning of the domain,
while the second one is  located in  the central section and has been shown to
be essential for the binding of actin.

****************************************

Kringles [1,2,3]  are triple-looped, disulfide cross-linked domains found in a
varying number  of  copies,  in some serine proteases and plasma proteins. The
kringle domain has been found in the following proteins:

 - Apolipoprotein A (38 copies).
 - Blood coagulation factor XII (Hageman factor) (1 copy).
 - Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) (4 copies).
 - Hepatocyte growth factor like protein (4 copies) [4].
 - Hepatocyte growth factor activator [1] (once) [5].
 - Plasminogen (5 copies).
 - Thrombin (2 copies).
 - Tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) (2 copies).
 - Urokinase-type plasminogen activator (1 copy).

The schematic  representation  of the structure of a typical kringle domain is

Kringle domains  are thought to  play a  role  in  binding  mediators, such as
membranes, other   proteins   or  phospholipids,  and  in  the  regulation  of
proteolytic activity.   As a  signature pattern  for this type  of domain,  we
selected a  conserved  sequence that contains two of the cysteines invovled in
disulfide bonds.

* EGF-like domain signatures and profile *
******************************************

A sequence of  about thirty  to forty amino-acid  residues  long found in  the
sequence of  epidermal  growth  factor  (EGF)  has been  shown  [1 to 6] to be
present, in  a more or less conserved form, in a large number of other, mostly
animal  proteins.  EGF  is  a  polypeptide  of about 50 amino acids with three
internal  disulfide  bridges.  It  first  binds with high affinity to specific
cell-surface receptors and then induces their dimerization, which is essential
for  activating  the  tyrosine  kinase  in  the  receptor  cytoplasmic domain,
initiating  a  signal  transduction  that  results  in  DNA synthesis and cell
proliferation.

A  common  feature  of  all  EGF-like  domains  is  that they are found in the
extracellular  domain  of  membrane-bound  proteins or in proteins known to be
secreted (exception: prostaglandin G/H synthase). The EGF-like domain includes
six cysteine residues which have been shown to be involved in disulfide bonds.
The  structure  of several EGF-like domains has been solved. The fold consists
of   two-stranded  beta-sheet  followed  by  a  loop  to  a  C-terminal  short
two-stranded sheet   (see   <PDB:1EGF>).   Subdomains  between  the  conserved
cysteines strongly  vary  in  length  as  shown  in  the  following  schematic
representation of the EGF-like domain:

                 +-------------------+        +-------------------------+

* Fibronectin type-II collagen-binding domain signature and profile *
*********************************************************************

Fibronectin is a plasma protein that binds cell surfaces and various compounds
including  collagen,  fibrin,  heparin,  DNA, and actin. The major part of the
sequence  of fibronectin consists of the repetition of three types of domains,
which  are  called  type  I,  II,  and  III  [1].  Type  II  domain  (FN2)  is
approximately  40 residues long, contains four conserved cysteines involved in
disulfide bonds and is part of the collagen-binding region of fibronectin [2].
In  fibronectin  the  minimal collagen binding region is formed by one FN1 and
two  FN2 domains. This suggests that the collagen-binding sites spans multiple
modules.

A schematic representation of  the position  of the invariant residues and the
topology of the disulfide bonds in FN2 domain is shown below.

                        +----------------------+
                        |                      |
        xxCxxPFx#xxxxxxxCxxxxxxxxWCxxxxx#xxx#x#Cxx
          |                       |
          +-----------------------+

'C': conserved cysteine involved in a disulfide bond.
'#': large hydrophobic residue.

The  3D-structure of  the FN2 domain has been determined (see <PDB:2FN2>) [3].
The  structure  consists  of  two  double-stranded  anti-parallel beta-sheets,
oriented  approximately  perpendicular to each other, and two irregular loops,
one  separating  the  two beta-sheets and the other between the two strands of
the  second  beta-sheet.  The  minimal  collagen-binding  region (FN1-FN2-FN2)
adopts a hairpin structure where the conserved aromatic residues of FN2 form a
hydrophobic  pocket  which  is thought to provide a binding site for non polar
residues in collagen [4].

Some proteins that contain an FN2 domain are listed below:

 - Blood coagulation factor XII (Hageman factor) (1 copy).
 - Bovine seminal plasma proteins PDC-109 (BSP-A1/A2) and BSP-A3 [5] (twice).
 - Cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (which is also the insulin-
   like growth factor II receptor) [6] (1 copy).
 - Mannose receptor of macrophages [7] (1 copy).
 - 180 Kd secretory phospholipase A2 receptor (1 copy) [8].
 - DEC-205 receptor (1 copy) [9].
   72  Kd and 92 Kd type IV collagenases (EC 3.4.24.24) (MMP-2 and MMP-9) [10]
   (3  copies).  Both  metalloproteinases  are strongly expressed in malignant
   tumors  and  have  been  attributed  to  metastasize. They  both  degradate
   collagen-IV  thus  facilitating  penetration  of  the basement membranes by
   tumor cells.
 - Hepatocyte growth factor activator [11] (1 copy).

* Hemopexin domain signature and hemopexin repeat profile *
***********************************************************

Hemopexin is a  serum glycoprotein that  binds  heme and transports it  to the
liver for breakdown and iron recovery, after  which the free hemopexin returns
to the circulation.  Structurally hemopexin consists of  two similar halves of
approximately two hundred  amino acid residues  connected  by a histidine-rich
hinge region. Each half is itself formed by the repetition of  a basic unit of
some 35 to 45 residues.  Hemopexin-like domains have  been found [1,2]  in two
other types of proteins:

 - In  vitronectin  (also  known  as  complement S protein and serum spreading
   factor), a multifunctional adhesion glycoprotein that is present abundantly
   in plasma  and  the  extracellular  matrix.  Vitronectin  consists of an N-
   terminal somatomedin   B   (see   <PDOC00453>)  and,  like  hemopexin,  two
   hemopexin-like domains [3].
 - In  most  members  of the matrix metalloproteinases family (matrixins) (see
   <PDOC00129>): MMP-1,  MMP-2,  MMP-3,  MMP-8, MMP-9, MMP-10, MMP-11, MMP-12,
   MMP-13, MMP-14,  MMP-15,  MMP-16,  MMP-17,  MMP-18, MMP-19, MMP-20, MMP-24,
   and MMP-25. These zinc endoproteases have a single hemopexin-like domain in
   their C-terminal section [4].

It is suggested that the  hemopexin domain facilitates binding to a variety of
molecules and proteins.

The hemopexin  domain  exhibits  the  shape of an oblate ellipsoidal disk. The
polypeptide chain  is organized in four beta-sheet (blades) I to IV, which are
almost symmetrically  arranged  around  a  central  axis in consecutive order,
giving rise to the formation of a four-bladed propeller (see <PDB:1PEX>). Each
propeller blade  or  repeat  is  made  up  of  four  antiparallel beta-strands
connected in a W-like strand topology, and is strongly twisted [5,6].

We developed  both  a  pattern  and  a  profile. The signature pattern for the
hemopexin domain  has  been  derived  from  the best conserved region which is
located at  the  beginning of the second repeat. The profile covers the entire
hemopexin repeat.

***************************************************
* P-type ('Trefoil') domain signature and profile *
***************************************************

A cysteine-rich  domain of  approximately forty five   amino-acid residues has
been found  in some extracellular eukaryotic proteins [1,2,3,4,5]. This domain
is known  as  either  the  'P',  'trefoil'  or  'TFF'  domain. It contains six
cysteines that  are  linked  by  three  disulfide bonds in a 1-5, 2-4, and 3-6
configuration. This   leads   to   a  characteristic  three  leafed  structure
('trefoil'). The  P-type domain is clearly composed of three looplike regions.
The central  core  of the domain consists of a short two-stranded antiparallel
beta-sheet, which  is  capped by an irregular loop and forms a central hairpin
(loop 3).  The beta-sheet is preceded by a short alpha-helix, with majority of
the remainder  of  the domain contained in two loops, which lie on either side
of the central hairpin (see <PDB:1E9T>) [6].

Proteins known to contain this domain are:

 - Protein pS2 (TFF1), a protein secreted by the stomach mucosa, whose gene is
   induced by  estrogen.  The  exact  function  of  pS2  is not known. It is a
   protein of about 65 residues and it contains a copy of the 'P' domain.
 - Spasmolytic  polypeptide  (SP) (TFF2), a protein of about 115 residues that
   inhibits gastrointestinal motility  and gastric acid secretion. SP could be
   a growth factor. It contains two tandem copies of the 'P' domain.
 - Intestinal  trefoil  factor (ITF) (TFF3), an intestinal protein of about 60
   residues which  may  have a role in promoting cell migration. It contains a
   copy of the 'P' domain.
 - Xenopus stomach proteins xP1 (one 'P' domain) and xP4 (four 'P' domains).
 - Xenopus  integumentary  mucins  A.1  (FIM-A.1 or preprospasmolysin) and C.1
   (FIM-C.1). These  proteins  could  be involved in defense against microbial
   infections by  protecting the epithelia from external environment. They are
   large proteins  (400 residues for A.1; more than 660 residues for C.1 whose
   sequence is  only partially known) that contain multiple copies  of the 'P'
   domain interspersed  with  tandem repeats of threonine-rich, O-glycosylated
   regions.
 - Xenopus  skin protein xp2 (or APEG) a protein that contains two 'P' domains
   and which  exists  in  two  alternative  spliced forms that differ from the
   inclusion of a N-terminal region of 320 residues that  consist of 33 tandem
   repeats of a G-[GE]-[AP](2,4)-A-E motif.
 - Zona pellucida sperm-binding protein B (ZP-B) (also known as ZP-X in rabbit
   and ZP-3  alpha in pig). This protein is a receptor-like glycoprotein whose
   extracellular region  contains  a  'P'  domain followed by a ZP domain (see
   <PDOC00577>).
 - Intestinal  sucrase-isomaltase    (EC 3.2.1.48 / EC 3.2.1.10), a vertebrate
   membrane-bound, multifunctional  enzyme  complex  which hydrolyzes sucrose,
   maltose and isomaltose (see <PDOC00120>).
 - Lysosomal  alpha-glucosidase    (EC  3.2.1.20) (acid maltase), a vertebrate
   extracellular glycosidase (see <PDOC00120>).

Structurally the P-type domain can be represented as shown below.

* Chitin-binding type-1 domain signature and profile *
******************************************************

Many  plants  respond  to pathogenic attack by producing defense proteins that
are   capable   of   reversible  binding  to  chitin,  an  N-acetylglucosamine
polysaccharide  present  in  the  cell  wall  of  fungi and the exoskeleton of
insects.  Most  of  these  chitin-binding proteins include a common structural
motif  of  30 to 43 residues organized around a conserved four-disulfide core,
known  as the chitin-binding domain type-1 [1]. The topological arrangement of
the four disulfide bonds is shown in the following figure:

                                +-------------+

'*': position of the pattern.

The  structure  of several chitin-binding domain type-1 have been solved, (see
for  example  <PDB:1HEV>)  [2].  The  chitin-binding  site  is  localized in a
beta-hairpin  loop formed by the second disulfide bridge. Conserved serine and
aromatic  residues  associated  with  the  hairpin-loop  are essential for the
chitin-binding  activity  [3].  The chitin-binding domain type-1 displays some
structural   similarities   with   the   chitin-binding   domain  type-2  (see
<PDOC50940>).

Some  of  the  proteins  containing  a chitin-binding domain type-1 are listed
below:

 - A number of non-leguminous plant lectins.  The  best characterized of these
   lectins are the  three highly homologous wheat  germ  agglutinins (WGA-1, 2
   and 3).  WGA  is  an  N-acetylglucosamine/N-acetylneuraminic  acid  binding
   lectin which structurally consists of a fourfold repetition of the 43 amino
   acid domain.  The same type of structure is found in a barley root-specific
   lectin as well as a rice lectin.
 - Plants  endochitinases  (EC  3.2.1.14)  from  class  IA  (see <PDOC00620>).
   Endochitinases are  enzymes  that  catalyze  the hydrolysis of the beta-1,4
   linkages of  N-acetyl  glucosamine  polymers  of  chitin.  Plant chitinases
   function as a defense against chitin containing fungal pathogens.  Class IA
   chitinases generally contain one copy of the chitin-binding domain at their
   N-terminal extremity.  An  exception  is  agglutinin/chitinase [4] from the
   stinging nettle Urtica dioica which contains two copies of the domain.
 - Hevein, a wound-induced protein found in the latex of rubber trees.
 - Win1 and win2, two wound-induced proteins from potato.
 - Kluyveromyces lactis killer toxin alpha subunit [5]. The  toxin  encoded by
   the linear plasmid pGKL1 is composed of three subunits:  alpha,  beta,  and
   gamma. The  gamma  subunit  harbors  toxin  activity and inhibits growth of
   sensitive yeast  strains  in  the  G1  phase  of  the cell cycle; the alpha
   subunit, which is proteolytically  processed from  a  larger precursor that
   also contains the beta subunit, is a chitinase (see <PDOC00839>).

The profile we developed covers the whole domain.

-Note: Hevein  is a strong allergen which is implied in the allergy to natural
 rubber  latex  (NRL).  NLR  can  be  associated  to  hypersensitivity to some
 plant-derived  foods  (latex-fruit  syndrome).  An increasing number of plant
 sources,  such  as avocado, banana, chestnut, kiwi, peach, tomato, potato and
 bell  pepper,  have  been associated with this syndrome. Several papers [6,7]
 have  shown  that  allergen  cross-reactivity  is  due to IgE antibodies that
 recognize  structurally  similar  epitopes  on  different  proteins  that are
 closely  related.  One  of  these  family  is  plant defence proteins class I
 chitinase containing a type-1 chitin-binding domain.

The 'four-disulfide core' or WAP domain comprises 8 cysteine residues involved
in  disulfide  bonds  in  a  conserved  arrangement  [1]. One or more of these
domains   occur   in   whey   acidic   protein   (WAP),   antileukoproteinase,
elastase-inhibitor  proteins and other structurally related proteins which are
listed below.

 - Whey  acidic  protein  (WAP).  WAP  is a major component of milk whey whose
   function  might  be  that  of  a  protease  inhibitor.  WAP consists of two
   'four-disulfide core' domains in most mammals.
 - Antileukoproteinase 1 (HUSI),  a mucous  fluid serine proteinase inhibitor.
   HUSI consists of two 'four-disulfide core' domains.
 - Elafin,  an  elastase-specific  inhibitor  from  human  skin [2,3].
 - Sodium/potassium ATPase inhibitors SPAI-1, -2, and -3 from pig [4].
 - Chelonianin, a protease inhibitor from  the eggs  of  red sea turtle.  This
   inhibitor  consists of  two  domains:  an N-terminal domain which  inhibits
   trypsin and  belongs  to  the  BPTI/Kunitz  family  of  inhibitors,  and  a
   C-terminal domain  which  inhibits subtilisin and is a 'four-disulfide core
   domain'.
 - Extracellular   peptidase   inhibitor  (WDNM1  protein),  involved  in  the
   metastatic potential of adenocarcinomas in rats.
 - Caltrin-like  protein  2  from guinea pig, which inhibits calcium transport
   into spermatozoa.
 - Kallmann  syndrome  protein  (Anosmin-1  or  KALIG-1)  [5,6]. This secreted
   protein  may  be  a  adhesion-like molecule with anti-protease activity. It
   contains a 'four-disulfide core domain' in its N-terminal part.
 - Whey  acidic protein (WAP) from the tammar wallaby, which consists of three
   'four-disulfide core' domains [7].
 - Waprins  from  snake  venom, such as omwaprin from Oxyuranus microlepidotus

* 'Homeobox' domain signature and profile *
*******************************************

The  'homeobox'  is  a  protein  domain  of  60  amino   acids [1 to 5]  first
identified in  a   number of Drosophila homeotic and segmentation proteins. It
has since been  found to  be  extremely well conserved in many  other animals,
including vertebrates.  This  domain binds DNA through a helix-turn-helix type
of structure.  Some  of  the proteins which contain  a homeobox domain play an
important  role  in  development.  Most of  these  proteins  are  known  to be
sequence specific DNA-binding transcription factors.  The  homeobox domain has
also been found  to  be  very  similar  to  a  region of the yeast mating type
proteins. These are sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins that act as  master
switches in yeast differentiation  by  controlling  gene  expression in a cell
type-specific fashion.

A  schematic  representation  of  the  homeobox domain  is  shown below.   The
helix-turn-helix region is shown by the symbols  'H' (for helix), and 't' (for
turn).

******************************************************
* Zinc finger C2H2-type domain signature and profile *
******************************************************

'Zinc finger' domains [1-5]  are nucleic acid-binding protein structures first
identified in  the Xenopus  transcription  factor TFIIIA.   These domains have
since been found  in  numerous nucleic acid-binding proteins.   A zinc  finger
domain is composed of 25 to 30 amino-acid residues.  There are two cysteine or
histidine residues  at  both extremities of the domain,  which are involved in
the tetrahedral coordination of a zinc atom. It has been proposed that such  a
domain interacts  with about five nucleotides. A schematic representation of a
zinc finger domain is shown below:

                                 x  x
                               x      x

                      x x x x x        x x x x x

Many classes  of  zinc  fingers  are characterized according to the number and
positions of  the  histidine  and  cysteine residues involved in the zinc atom
coordination.  In the  first class to be characterized, called C2H2, the first
pair of zinc coordinating  residues  are cysteines, while the  second pair are
histidines. A  number  of  experimental  reports  have  demonstrated the zinc-
dependent DNA or RNA binding property of some members of this class.

Some of the proteins known to include C2H2-type zinc fingers are listed below.
We have indicated, between brackets, the number of zinc  finger regions  found

In addition to the conserved zinc ligand residues it has been shown [6] that a
number of other positions are  also  important for the structural integrity of
the C2H2 zinc fingers. The  best  conserved  position is  found  four residues
after the second cysteine; it is generally an aromatic or aliphatic residue. A
profile was also developed that spans the whole domain.

* Leucine zipper pattern *
**************************

A structure,  referred to as the 'leucine zipper' [1,2], has been proposed  to
explain  how some eukaryotic gene regulatory proteins work. The leucine zipper
consist  of a  periodic  repetition  of  leucine  residues  at  every  seventh
position over a distance covering eight helical turns. The segments containing
these  periodic  arrays of leucine residues seem to exist in  an alpha-helical
conformation. The leucine side chains extending from one alpha-helix  interact
with those  from a similar alpha helix  of  a second polypeptide, facilitating
dimerization; the structure formed by cooperation of these two regions forms a
coiled coil [3]. The leucine zipper pattern is present in many gene regulatory
proteins, such as:

 - The CCATT-box and enhancer binding protein (C/EBP).
 - The cAMP response element (CRE) binding proteins (CREB, CRE-BP1, ATFs).
 - The Jun/AP1 family of transcription factors.
 - The yeast general control protein GCN4.
 - The fos oncogene, and the fos-related proteins fra-1 and fos B.
 - The C-myc, L-myc and N-myc oncogenes.
 - The octamer-binding transcription factor 2 (Oct-2/OTF-2).

-Consensus pattern: L-x(6)-L-x(6)-L-x(6)-L
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: All    those

-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: some 600 other sequences from every
 category of protein families.

-Note: As this is far from being a specific  pattern you should be cautious in
 citing the presence of such pattern in a protein  if it has not been shown to
 be a nuclear DNA-binding protein.

* Eukaryotic RNA recognition motif profile *
********************************************

Many eukaryotic proteins  that are known or  supposed  to bind single-stranded
RNA contain one or more  copies of a putative  RNA-binding  domain of about 90
amino acids [1,2]. This domain is known as the RNA recognition motif (RRM).

This region has been found in the following proteins:

   ** Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins **
 - hnRNP A1 (helix destabilizing protein) (twice).
 - hnRNP A2/B1 (twice).
 - hnRNP C (C1/C2) (once).
 - hnRNP E (UP2) (at least once).
 - hnRNP G (once).

   ** Small nuclear ribonucleoproteins **
 - U1 snRNP 70 Kd (once).
 - U1 snRNP A  (once).
 - U2 snRNP B'' (once).

   ** Pre-RNA and mRNA associated proteins **
 - Protein synthesis initiation factor  4B (eIF-4B) [3], a  protein  essential
   for the binding of mRNA to ribosomes (once).
 - Nucleolin (4 times).
 - Yeast single-stranded nucleic acid-binding protein (gene SSB1) (once).
 - Yeast protein NSR1 (twice). NSR1  is  involved  in  pre-rRNA processing; it
   specifically binds nuclear localization sequences.
 - Poly(A) binding protein (PABP) (4 times).

   ** Others **
 - Drosophila sex determination protein Sex-lethal (Sxl) (twice).
 - Drosophila sex determination protein Transformer-2 (Tra-2) (once).
 - Drosophila 'elav' protein (3 times), which is  probably involved in the RNA
   metabolism of neurons.
 - Human paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis antigen HuD (3 times) [4],  which is
   highly similar to  elav  and  which  may play a role in neuron-specific RNA
   processing.
 - Drosophila 'bicoid' protein (once) [5], a segment-polarity homeobox protein
   that may also bind to specific mRNAs.
 - La antigen (once), a protein which  may play a role in the transcription of
   RNA polymerase III.
 - The 60 Kd Ro protein (once), a putative RNP complex protein.
 - A maize protein induced by abscisic acid in response to water stress, which
   seems to be a RNA-binding protein.
 - Three  tobacco  proteins,  located  in  the  chloroplast  [6], which may be
   involved in splicing and/or processing of chloroplast RNAs (twice).
 - X16 [7], a mammalian protein  which  may  be involved in RNA processing  in
   relation with cellular proliferation and/or maturation.
 - Insulin-induced growth response protein Cl-4 from rat (twice).
 - Nucleolysins  TIA-1  and  TIAR  (3  times)  [8] which possesses nucleolytic
   activity against  cytotoxic  lymphocyte  target  cells.  may be involved in
   apoptosis.
 - Yeast RNA15 protein, which plays a role in mRNA stability  and/or  poly-(A)
   tail length [9].

Inside the RRM there are two regions which are highly conserved. The first one
is a  hydrophobic  segment  of six residues (which is called the RNP-2 motif),
the second  one is an octapeptide motif (which is called RNP-1 or RNP-CS). The
position of  both  motifs  in  the  domain is shown in the following schematic
representation:

  xxxxxxx######xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx########xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

* Nuclear hormone receptors DNA-binding domain signature and profile *
**********************************************************************

Nuclear  hormone  receptors  are  ligand-activated  transcription factors that
regulate  gene  expression by interacting with specific DNA sequences upstream
of  their  target  genes.  In  vertebrates,  these  proteins  regulate diverse
biological  processes  such as pattern formation, cellular differentiation and
homeostasis [1 to 6].

Classical nuclear hormone receptors contain two conserved regions, the hormone
binding  domain and a DNA-binding domain (DBD) that is composed of two C4-type
zinc  fingers.  The  DBD  is  responsible for targeting the receptors to their
hormone  response  elements  (HRE).  It  binds  as  a  dimer with each monomer
recognizing  a  six  base  pair  sequence of DNA. The vast majority of targets
contain  the  same  5'-AGGTCA-3'  consensus sequence [7]. In some cases a less
conserved  C-terminal  extension  of  the core DBD confers the DNA selectivity
[8].

The  two zinc fingers fold to form a single structural domain (see <PDB:1HCQ>)
[9,10].  The  structure consists of two helices perpendicular to each other. A
zinc ion, coordinated by four conserved cysteines, holds the base of a loop at
the  N  terminus  of  each  helix.  The  helix  of each monomer makes sequence
specific contacts in the major groove of the DNA.

Proteins  known  to  contain a nuclear hormone receptor DNA-binding domain are
listed below:

 - Androgen receptor (AR).

   steroidogenic P450 genes.
 - Apolipoprotein   AI   regulatory   protein-1   (ARP-1),  required  for  the
   transcription of apolipoprotein AI.
 - Peroxisome  proliferator  activated receptors (PPAR), transcription factors
   specifically activated   by  peroxisome  proliferators.  They  control  the
   peroxisomal beta-oxidation  pathway  of  fatty acids by activating the gene
   for acyl-CoA oxidase.

* 'Homeobox' antennapedia-type protein signature *
**************************************************

The homeotic  Hox  proteins  are sequence-specific transcription factors. They
are part  of  a  developmental  regulatory  system  that  provides  cells with
specific  positional identities on the anterior-posterior (A-P) axis [1].  The
hox proteins  contain  a  'homeobox'  domain. In Drosophila and other insects,
there are eight different Hox genes  that  are  encoded in two gene complexes,
ANT-C and BX-C. In vertebrates there are 38 genes organized in four complexes.

In six of the eight Drosophila Hox genes the homeobox domain is highly similar
and a  conserved hexapeptide  is found five to sixteen amino acids upstream of
the homeobox domain. The six Drosophila proteins that belong to this group are
antennapedia (Antp),  abdominal-A (abd-A), deformed (Dfd), proboscipedia (pb),
sex combs reduced (scr)  and ultrabithorax (ubx) and are collectively known as
the 'antennapedia' subfamily.

In vertebrates  the  corresponding  Hox genes are known [2] as Hox-A2, A3, A4,
A5, A6,  A7,  Hox-B1,  B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, B7, B8, Hox-C4, C5, C6, C8, Hox-D1,
D3, D4 and D8.

Caenorhabditis elegans lin-39 and mab-5 are also members of the 'antennapedia'
subfamily.

As a signature pattern  for this subfamily of  homeobox proteins, we have used
the conserved hexapeptide.

Most proteins  which contain a 'homeobox' domain  can  be classified [1,2], on
the basis of their sequence characteristics, in three  subfamilies: engrailed,
antennapedia and paired.   Proteins currently known to belong to the engrailed
subfamily are:

 - Drosophila segmentation polarity protein engrailed (en) which specifies the
   body segmentation  pattern  and  is  required  for  the  development of the
   central nervous system.
 - Drosophila invected protein (inv).
 - Silk moth proteins engrailed and invected,  which  may  be  involved in the
   compartmentalization of the silk gland.
 - Honeybee E30 and E60.
 - Grasshopper (Schistocerca americana) G-En.
 - Mammalian and birds En-1 and En-2.
 - Zebrafish  Eng-1, -2 and -3.
 - Sea urchin (Tripneusteas gratilla) SU-HB-en.
 - Leech (Helobdella triserialis) Ht-En.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans ceh-16.

Engrailed homeobox proteins are characterized  by  the presence of a conserved
region of  some  20  amino-acid  residues  located  at  the  C-terminal of the
'homeobox' domain.  As  a signature pattern for this subfamily of proteins, we
have used a stretch of eight perfectly conserved residues in this region.

***************************************
* Paired domain signature and profile *
***************************************

The  paired  domain is a ~126 amino acid DNA-binding domain, which is found in
eukaryotic  transcription  regulatory  proteins involved in embryogenesis. The
domain  was originally described as the 'paired box' in the Drosophila protein
paired  (prd)  [1,2]. The paired domain is generally located in the N-terminal
part.  An  octapeptide  [3]  and/or  a homeodomain (see <PDOC00027>) can occur
C-terminal  to  the  paired  domain, as well as a Pro-Ser-Thr-rich C-terminus.
Paired domain proteins can function as transcription repressors or activators.
The paired domain contains three subdomains, which show functional differences
in DNA-binding.

The  crystal structures of prd and Pax proteins show that the DNA-bound paired
domain  is bipartite, consisting of an N-terminal subdomain (PAI or NTD) and a
C-terminal subdomain (RED or CTD), connected by a linker (see <PDB:1K78>). PAI
and  RED  each  form  a  three-helical  fold, with the most C-terminal helices
comprising  a helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif that binds the DNA major groove. In
addition,   the   PAI   subdomain  encompasses  an  N-terminal  beta-turn  and
beta-hairpin,  also named 'wing', participating in DNA-binding. The linker can
bind into the DNA minor groove. Different Pax proteins and their alternatively
spliced  isoforms  use  different  (sub)domains for DNA-binding to mediate the
specificity of sequence recognition [4,5].

Some proteins known to contain a paired domain:

 - Drosophila paired (prd), a segmentation pair-rule class protein.
 - Drosophila  gooseberry  proximal  (gsb-p)  and  gooseberry  distal (gsb-d),
   segmentation polarity class proteins.
 - Drosophila Pox-meso and Pox-neuro proteins.

 The Pax proteins:
 - Mammalian protein Pax1, which may play a role in the formation of segmented
   structures in the embryo. In mouse, mutations in Pax1 produce the undulated
   phenotype, characterized   by  vertebral  malformations  along  the  entire
   rostro-caudal axis.
 - Mammalian  protein  Pax2,  a  probable transcription factor that may have a
   role in kidney cell differentiation.
 - Mammalian  protein  Pax3.  Pax3  is expressed during early neurogenesis. In
   Man, defects  in  Pax3  are  the  cause  of Waardenburg's syndrome (WS), an
   autosomal dominant combination of deafness and pigmentary disturbance.
 - Mammalian  protein Pax5, also known as B-cell specific transcription factor
   (BSAP).  Pax5  is  involved in the regulation of the CD19 gene. It plays an
   important  role in B-cell differentiation as well as neural development and
   spermatogenesis.
 - Mammalian  protein Pax6 (oculorhombin). Pax6 is a transcription factor with
   important  functions  in eye and nasal development. In Man, defects in Pax6
   are  the  cause  of  aniridia type II (AN2), an autosomal dominant disorder
   characterized by complete or partial absence of the iris.
 - Mammalian protein Pax8, required in thyroid development.
 - Mammalian protein Pax9. In man, defects in Pax9 cause oligodontia.
 - Zebrafish proteins Pax[Zf-a] and Pax[Zf-b].

We  use  the  region  spanning  positions  34  to 50 of the paired domain as a
signature  pattern. This conserved region spans the DNA-binding HTH located in
the  N-terminal  subdomain. We also developed a profile that covers the entire
paired  domain,  including  the PAI and RED subdomains and which allows a more
sensitive detection.

*****************************************************
* POU-specific (POUs) domain signatures and profile *
*****************************************************

The POU  (pronounced 'pow') domain [1 to 7 ] is a highly charged 155-162-amino
acid region  of  sequence  similarity  which  has been identified in the three
mammalian transcription  factors Pit-1, Oct-1, and Oct-2 and in the product of
the nematode  gene  unc-86.  The POU domain is a bipartite DNA binding protein
module that  binds  selectively to the DNA octamer motif ATGCAAAT and a subset
of derivatives. It consists of two subdomains, a C-terminal homeodomain (POUh)
(see <PDOC00027>)  and  an  N-terminal  75-  to 82-residue POU-specific (POUs)
region separated  by  a short non-conserved linker. The POU-specific region or
'box' can  be  subdivided  further into two highly conserved regions, A and B,
separated by  a less highly conserved segment. The POUs domain is always found
in association with a POUh domain, and both are required for high affinity and
sequence-specific DNA binding.

The POUs  domain consists of four alpha helices packed to enclose an extensive
hydrophobic core  (see  <PDB:1POU>).  The  POUs domain contains an unusual HTH
structure, which  differs  from  the  canonical HTH motif in the length of the
first alpha helix and the turn. The region of hypervariability located between
subdomains A  and  B  lies within the sequence corresponding to the C-terminal
end of  helix  2  and  the linker between helices 2 and 3. In the model of the
POUs-DNA complex,  the  C-terminus  of  helix  2 and the turn of the HTH motif
project away from the DNA such that sequence variability in this region can be
accomodated without  adversely  affecting DNA binding [8].

Some proteins currently known to contain a POUs domain are listed below:

 - Oct-1  (or  OTF-1,  NF-A1)  (gene POU2F1), a transcription factor for small
   nuclear RNA and histone H2B genes.
 - Oct-2  (or  OTF-2,  NF-A2)  (gene  POU2F2),  a  transcription  factor  that
   specifically binds  to  the  immunoglobulin  promoters  octamer  motif  and
   activates these genes.
 - Oct-3  (or  Oct-4,  NF-A3)  (gene POU5F1), a transcription factor that also
   binds to the octamer motif.
 - Oct-6    (or   OTF-6, SCIP) (gene POU3F1), an octamer-binding transcription
   factor thought to be involved in early embryogenesis and neurogenesis.
 - Oct-7  (or  N-Oct 3, OTF-7, Brn-2) (gene POU3F2), a nervous-system specific
   octamer-binding transcription factor.
 - Oct-11 (or OTF-11) (gene POU2F3), an octamer-binding transcription factor.
 - Pit-1  (or  GHF-1)  (gene  POU1F1),  a transcription factor that  activates
   growth hormone and prolactin genes.
 - Brn-1 (or OTF-8) (gene POU3F3).
 - Brn-3A (or RDC-1) (gene POU4F1), a probable transcription factor  that  may
   play a role in neuronal tissue differentiation.
 - Brn-3B (gene POU4F2), a probable transcription factor  that may play a role
   in determining  or  maintaining  the identities of a small subset of visual
   system neurons.
 - Brn-3C (gene POU4F3).
 - Brn-4 (or OTF-9) (gene POU3F4), a probable transcription factor which exert
   its primary  action  widely  during  early neural development and in a very
   limited set of neurons in the mature brain.
 - Mpou  (or  Brn-5,  Emb)  (gene  POU6F1),  a transcription factor that binds
   preferentially to a variant of the octamer motif.
 - Skn, that activates cytokeratin 10 (k10) gene expression.
 - Sprm-1,  a  transcription  factor  that binds preferentially to the octamer
   motif and  that  may exert a regulatory function in meiotic events that are
   required for terminal differentiation of male germ cell.
 - Unc-86,  a  Caenorhabditis  elegans  transcription  factor involved in cell
   lineage and differentiation.
 - Cf1-a, a Drosophila neuron-specific  transcription factor necessary for the
   expression of the dopa decarboxylase gene (dcc).
 - I-POU, a Drosophila protein that forms a stable heterodimeric  complex with
   Cf1-a and inhibits its action.
 - Drosophila protein nubbin/twain (PDM-1 or DPou-19).
 - Drosophila protein didymous (PDM-2 or DPou-28) that may play multiple roles
   during development.
 - Bombyx mori silk gland factor 3 (SGF-3).
 - Xenopus proteins Pou1, Pou2, and Pou3.
 - Zebrafish proteins Pou1, Pou2, Pou[C], ZP-12, ZP-23, ZP-47 and ZP-50.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans protein ceh-6.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans protein ceh-18.

We  have derived  two  signature patterns for the 'POU' domain.  The first one
spans positions 15 to 27 of the domain, the second positions 42 to 55. We have
also developed a profile which covers the entire POUs domain.

************************************************************
* Basic-leucine zipper (bZIP) domain signature and profile *
************************************************************

The  bZIP  superfamily  [1,2]  of eukaryotic DNA-binding transcription factors
groups  together  proteins  that  contain  a  basic region mediating sequence-
specific  DNA-binding  followed by a leucine zipper (see <PDOC00029>) required
for  dimerization. bZIP domains usually bind a pallindromic 6 nucleotide site,
but the specificity can be altered by interaction with accessory factor [3].

Several  structure  of bZIP have been solved (see for example <PDB:1AN2>) [4].
The  basic  region and the leucine zipper form a contiguous alpha helice where
the  four hydrophobic residues of the leucine zipper are oriented on one side.
This  conformation allows dimerization in parallel and it bends the helices so
that the newly functional dimer forms a flexible fork where the basic domains,
at the N-terminal open end, can then interact with DNA. The two leucine zipper
are therefore oriented perpendicular to the DNA [4,5].

This family is quite large and we only list here some representative members.

 - Transcription factor AP-1, which binds  selectively to enhancer elements in
   the cis control regions of SV40 and metallothionein IIA.   AP-1, also known
   as c-jun, is  the  cellular  homolog  of the avian sarcoma virus 17 (ASV17)
   oncogene v-jun.
 - Jun-B and jun-D,  probable transcription factors which  are  highly similar
   to jun/AP-1.
 - The fos protein, a  proto-oncogene  that  forms  a  non-covalent dimer with
   c-jun.
 - The fos-related proteins fra-1, and fos B.
 - Mammalian  cAMP  response element (CRE) binding proteins CREB, CREM, ATF-1,
   ATF-3, ATF-4, ATF-5, ATF-6 and LRF-1.
 - Maize  Opaque  2,  a trans-acting transcriptional activator involved in the
   regulation of the production of zein proteins during endosperm.
 - Arabidopsis G-box binding factors  GBF1 to GBF4,  Parsley CPRF-1 to CPRF-3,
   Tobacco TAF-1 and wheat EMBP-1. All these  proteins bind the G-box promoter
   elements of many plant genes.
 - Drosophila  protein  Giant,  which  represses  the  expression  of both the
   kruppel and knirps segmentation gap genes.
 - Drosophila Box B binding factor 2 (BBF-2), a transcriptional activator that
   binds to  fat  body-specific  enhancers  of  alcohol dehydrogenase and yolk
   protein genes.
 - Drosophila segmentation protein cap'n'collar (gene cnc),  which is involved
   in head morphogenesis.
 - Caenorhabditis  elegans skn-1, a developmental protein involved in the fate
   of ventral blastomeres in the early embryo.

********************************************
* Myb-type HTH DNA-binding domain profiles *
********************************************

The  myb  family can be classified into three groups: the myb-type HTH domain,
which  binds  DNA,  the  SANT  domain,  which is a protein-protein interaction
module  (see  <PDOC51293>)  and  the  myb-like  domain that can be involved in
either of these functions.

The myb-type HTH domain is a DNA-binding, helix-turn-helix (HTH) domain of ~55
amino   acids,   typically   occurring   in  a  tandem  repeat  in  eukaryotic
transcription  factors.  The  domain  is  named  after the retroviral oncogene
v-myb,  and  its  cellular counterpart c-myb, which encode nuclear DNA-binding
proteins  that  specifically  recognize  the  sequence  YAAC(G/T)G  [1,2]. Myb
proteins  contain  three tandem repeats of 51 to 53 amino acids, termed R1, R2
and  R3.  This  repeat  region  is  involved in DNA-binding and R2 and R3 bind
directly  to  the  DNA  major  groove.  The  major part of the first repeat is
missing in retroviral v-Myb sequences and in plant myb-related (R2R3) proteins
[3].  A  single  myb-type HTH DNA-binding domain occurs in TRF1 and TRF2.

The  3D-structure  of  the  myb-type HTH domain forms three alpha-helices (see
<PDB:1H88; C>) [4]. The second and third helices connected via a turn comprise
the  helix-turn-helix  motif.  Helix  3  is termed the recognition helix as it
binds the DNA major groove, like in other HTHs.

Some proteins known to contain a myb-type HTH domain:

 - Fruit fly myb protein [2].
 - Vertebrate myb-like proteins A-myb and B-myb.
 - Maize  anthocyanin  regulatory  C1  protein,  a  trans-acting  factor which
   controls the expression of genes involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis.
 - Maize P protein [5], a trans-acting factor which regulates the biosynthetic
   pathway of a flavonoid-derived pigment in certain floral tissues.
 - Arabidopsis thaliana protein GL1/GLABROUS1 [6], required for the initiation
   of differentiation of leaf hair cells (trichomes).
 - Maize and barley myb-related proteins Zm1, Zm38 and Hv1, Hv33 [7].
 - Yeast BAS1 [8], a transcriptional activator for the HIS4 gene.
 - Yeast REB1 [9], which recognizes sites  within  both  the  enhancer and the
   promoter  of  rRNA  transcription,  as  well  as  upstream  of  many  genes
   transcribed by RNA polymerase II.
 - Fission  yeast  cdc5,  a  possible  transcription  factor whose activity is
   required for cell cycle progression and growth during G2.
 - Fission yeast myb1, which regulates telomere length and function.
 - Baker's yeast pre-mRNA-splicing factor CEF1.
 - Vertebrate telomeric repeat-binding factors 1 and 2 (TRF1/2), which bind to
   telomeric DNA and are involved in telomere length regulation.

We  have  developed a profile, which has been manually adapted to specifically
detect  the  DNA-binding  myb-type  HTH  domain.  A second general profile was
developed  for  detection  of  the  myb-like domain with a high sensitivity. A
third profile was developed for the SANT domain (see <PDOC51293>).

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the first profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 2.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the second profile:  ALL,
 except 25.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 2.

-Note:  The  profiles are in competition with one another and with the profile
 of the SANT domain (see <PDOC51293>).

-Last update:  February  2007  /  Profile  and  text  revised;  profile added;

**********************************************************
* Myc-type, basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain profile *
**********************************************************

A number of  eukaryotic proteins,  which probably  are sequence specific  DNA-
binding proteins that act as transcription  factors,  share a conserved domain
of 40 to 50 amino acid residues.  It has been proposed [1] that this domain is
formed  of two amphipathic helices  joined by  a variable length linker region
that could form a loop.  This 'helix-loop-helix' (HLH) domain mediates protein
dimerization and  has  been  found  in  the  proteins listed below [2,3]. Most
of these  proteins  have an extra basic region of about 15 amino acid residues
that is  adjacent  to  the HLH domain and specifically binds to  DNA. They are
refered as  basic helix-loop-helix  proteins (bHLH), and are classified in two
groups: class  A  (ubiquitous)  and  class B (tissue-specific). Members of the
bHLH family  bind variations on the core sequence 'CANNTG', also refered to as
the E-box motif. The homo- or heterodimerization mediated by the HLH domain is
independent of,  but  necessary  for  DNA  binding,  as  two basic regions are
required for  DNA  binding activity. The HLH proteins lacking the basic domain
(Emc, Id)  function  as  negative regulators since they form heterodimers, but
fail to  bind  DNA.  The  hairy-related proteins (hairy, E(spl), deadpan) also
repress transcription  although    they  can  bind  DNA.  The proteins of this
subfamily act together with co-repressor proteins, like groucho, through their
C-terminal motif WRPW.

 - The myc family  of cellular oncogenes [4],  which  is  currently  known  to
   contain four  members:  c-myc,  N-myc,  L-myc, and B-myc. The myc genes are
   thought to play a role in cellular differentiation and proliferation.
 - Proteins involved in myogenesis (the induction of muscle cells). In mammals
   MyoD1 (Myf-3),  myogenin (Myf-4),  Myf-5, and  Myf-6 (Mrf4 or herculin), in
   birds CMD1 (QMF-1), in  Xenopus MyoD and MF25,  in  Caenorhabditis  elegans
   CeMyoD, and in Drosophila nautilus (nau).
 - Vertebrate proteins that bind specific DNA sequences ('E boxes') in various
   immunoglobulin  chains  enhancers: E2A or ITF-1 (E12/pan-2 and  E47/pan-1),
   ITF-2 (tcf4), TFE3, and TFEB.
 - Vertebrate neurogenic differentiation factor 1 that acts as differentiation
   factor during neurogenesis.
 - Vertebrate MAX  protein, a  transcription regulator  that forms a sequence-
   specific DNA-binding protein complex with myc or mad.
 - Vertebrate   Max  Interacting  Protein  1 (MXI1  protein)  which  acts as a
   transcriptional repressor and  may antagonize myc transcriptional  activity
   by competing for max.
 - Proteins of the bHLH/PAS superfamily which  are transcriptional activators.
   In mammals, AH receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT), single-minded homologs
   (SIM1 and SIM2),  hypoxia-inducible  factor 1  alpha  (HIF1A), AH  receptor
   (AHR), neuronal  pas  domain  proteins  (NPAS1  and NPAS2), endothelial pas
   domain protein  1  (EPAS1),  mouse  ARNT2, and human BMAL1. In  drosophila,
   single-minded  (SIM),  AH receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT), trachealess
   protein (TRH), and similar protein (SIMA).
 - Mammalian transcription factors HES, which  repress transcription by acting
   on two types of DNA sequences, the E box and the N box.
 - Mammalian   MAD  protein (max dimerizer)  which  acts  as   transcriptional
   repressor and may antagonize myc transcriptional  activity by competing for
   max.
 - Mammalian  Upstream Stimulatory Factor 1 and 2 (USF1 and USF2),  which bind
   to  a  symmetrical  DNA  sequence that is found in a variety  of viral  and
   cellular promoters.
 - Human lyl-1 protein; which is involved, by chromosomal translocation, in T-
   cell leukemia.
 - Human transcription factor AP-4.
 - Mouse  helix-loop-helix  proteins  MATH-1  and MATH-2 which activate E box-
   dependent transcription in collaboration with E47.
 - Mammalian stem cell protein (SCL) (also known as tal1), a protein which may
   play an important role in hemopoietic differentiation. SCL is involved, by
   chromosomal translocation, in stem-cell leukemia.
 - Mammalian proteins Id1 to Id4 [5].  Id (inhibitor of DNA binding)  proteins
   lack a  basic  DNA-binding  domain  but  are able to form heterodimers with
   other HLH proteins, thereby inhibiting binding to DNA.
 - Drosophila extra-macrochaetae (emc)  protein, which participates in sensory
   organ patterning  by  antagonizing the neurogenic  activity of the achaete-
   scute complex. Emc is the homolog of mammalian Id proteins.
 - Human   Sterol   Regulatory   Element   Binding   Protein  1  (SREBP-1),  a
   transcriptional activator  that  binds  to  the sterol regulatory element 1
   (SRE-1) found in the flanking region of the LDLR gene and in other genes.
 - Drosophila  achaete-scute (AS-C)  complex  proteins  T3 (l'sc), T4 (scute),
   T5 (achaete)  and  T8 (asense).  The AS-C  proteins  are  involved  in  the
   determination  of  the neuronal precursors in the peripheral nervous system
   and the central nervous system.
 - Mammalian  homologs   of  achaete-scute  proteins, the  MASH-1  and  MASH-2
   proteins.

 - Drosophila atonal protein (ato) which is involved in neurogenesis.
 - Drosophila daughterless (da) protein, which is  essential  for neurogenesis
   and sex-determination.
 - Drosophila deadpan  (dpn), a hairy-like protein involved in the  functional
   differentiation of neurons.
 - Drosophila delilah (dei) protein,  which is plays an important role  in the
   differentiation of epidermal cells into muscle.
 - Drosophila  hairy (h)  protein, a transcriptional repressor which regulates
   the embryonic segmentation and adult bristle patterning.
 - Drosophila enhancer of split  proteins E(spl), that are hairy-like proteins
   active during neurogenesis. also act as transcriptional repressors.
 - Drosophila twist (twi) protein, which  is involved in  the establishment of
   germ layers in embryos.

 - Maize anthocyanin regulatory proteins R-S and LC.

 - Yeast centromere-binding protein 1 (CPF1 or CBF1). This protein is involved
   in chromosomal segregation.  It  binds  to a highly conserved DNA sequence,
   found in centromers and in several promoters.
 - Yeast INO2 and INO4 proteins.
 - Yeast  phosphate  system  positive  regulatory protein PHO4 which interacts
   with the upstream activating sequence of several acid phosphatase genes.
 - Yeast  serine-rich  protein  TYE7  that  is  required  for ty-mediated ADH2
   expression.
 - Neurospora crassa  nuc-1, a protein  that  activates  the  transcription of
   structural genes for phosphorus acquisition.

   process.

* DEAD and DEAH box families ATP-dependent helicases signatures *
*****************************************************************

A number of eukaryotic and  prokaryotic proteins have been characterized [1,2,
3] on  the  basis of their structural similarity. They all seem to be involved
in ATP-dependent,  nucleic-acid  unwinding. Proteins currently known to belong
to this family are:

 - Initiation factor eIF-4A. Found in eukaryotes, this protein is a subunit of
   a high  molecular  weight  complex  involved  in  5'cap recognition and the
   binding of mRNA to ribosomes. It is an ATP-dependent RNA-helicase.
 - PRP5  and PRP28. These yeast proteins are involved in various ATP-requiring
   steps of the pre-mRNA splicing process.
 - Pl10, a mouse protein expressed specifically during spermatogenesis.
 - An3, a Xenopus putative RNA helicase, closely related to Pl10.
 - SPP81/DED1 and DBP1, two  yeast  proteins  probably  involved  in  pre-mRNA
   splicing and related to Pl10.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans helicase glh-1.
 - MSS116, a yeast protein required for mitochondrial splicing.
 - SPB4, a yeast protein involved in the maturation of 25S ribosomal RNA.
 - p68, a human nuclear antigen. p68 has ATPase and DNA-helicase activities in
   vitro. It is involved in cell growth and division.
 - Rm62 (p62), a Drosophila putative RNA helicase related to p68.
 - DBP2, a yeast protein related to p68.
 - DHH1, a yeast protein.
 - DRS1, a yeast protein involved in ribosome assembly.
 - MAK5, a yeast protein involved in maintenance of dsRNA killer plasmid.
 - ROK1, a yeast protein.
 - ste13, a fission yeast protein.
 - Vasa, a Drosophila protein important for oocyte formation and specification
   of of embryonic posterior structures.
 - Me31B, a Drosophila maternally expressed protein of unknown function.
 - dbpA, an Escherichia coli putative RNA helicase.
 - deaD, an Escherichia coli  putative  RNA  helicase  which  can  suppress  a
   mutation in the rpsB gene for ribosomal protein S2.
 - rhlB, an Escherichia coli putative RNA helicase.
 - rhlE, an Escherichia coli putative RNA helicase.
 - srmB, an Escherichia coli protein that shows RNA-dependent ATPase activity.
   It probably interacts with 23S ribosomal RNA.

 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical proteins T26G10.1, ZK512.2 and ZK686.2.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YHR065c.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YHR169w.
 - Fission yeast hypothetical protein SpAC31A2.07c.
 - Bacillus subtilis hypothetical protein yxiN.

All these proteins  share a number of conserved sequence motifs.  Some of them
are specific  to  this  family  while  others  are shared by other ATP-binding
proteins or  by   proteins belonging to the helicases `superfamily' [4].   One
of these motifs, called the 'D-E-A-D-box', represents a special version of the
B motif of ATP-binding proteins.

Some other proteins belong to a subfamily which have His instead of the second
Asp  and  are  thus  said  to  be  'D-E-A-H-box'  proteins [3,5,6].   Proteins
currently known to belong to this subfamily are:

 - PRP2,  PRP16,  PRP22  and  PRP43.  These yeast proteins are all involved in
   various ATP-requiring steps of the pre-mRNA splicing process.
 - Fission yeast prh1, which my be involved in pre-mRNA splicing.
 - Male-less (mle),  a   Drosophila  protein  required in  males,  for  dosage
   compensation of X chromosome linked genes.
 - RAD3 from yeast. RAD3 is a DNA  helicase involved in excision repair of DNA
   damaged by   UV light,  bulky adducts  or  cross-linking  agents.   Fission
   yeast rad15 (rhp3)  and mammalian  DNA excision repair protein XPD (ERCC-2)
   are the homologs of RAD3.
 - Yeast CHL1 (or CTF1), which  is important  for  chromosome transmission and
   normal cell cycle progression in G(2)/M.
 - Yeast TPS1.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YKL078w.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical proteins C06E1.10 and K03H1.2.
 - Poxviruses' early transcription  factor 70 Kd subunit  which  acts with RNA
   polymerase to initiate transcription from early gene promoters.
 - I8, a putative vaccinia virus helicase.
 - hrpA, an Escherichia coli putative RNA helicase.

We have developed signature patterns for both subfamilies.

* Bacterial regulatory proteins, araC family signature and profile *
********************************************************************

The many bacterial transcription regulation proteins which bind DNA  through a
'helix-turn-helix' motif can  be  classified into subfamilies  on the basis of
sequence similarities. One  of these subfamilies groups together the following
proteins [1,2,3]:

 - aarP,  a  transcriptional  activator  of the 2'-N-acetyltransferase gene in
   Providencia stuartii.
 - ada,  an  Escherichia  coli and Salmonella typhimurium bifunctional protein
   that repairs  alkylated  guanine  in DNA by transferring the alkyl group at
   the O(6)  position  to  a  cysteine  residue  in the enzyme. The methylated
   protein acts  a  positive  regulator  of its own synthesis and of the alkA,
   alkB and aidB genes.
 - adaA, a Bacillus subtilis  bifunctional   protein  that   acts  both  as  a
   transcriptional activator of the ada operon and as a methylphosphotriester-
   DNA alkyltransferase.
 - adiY, an Escherichia coli protein of unknown function.
 - aggR,  the  transcriptional  activator  of  aggregative adherence fimbria I
   expression in enteroaggregative Escherichia coli.
 - appY, a protein  which  acts  as  a  transcriptional   activator  of   acid
   phosphatase and other proteins during  the deceleration phase of growth and
   acts as a repressor for other proteins that  are synthesized in exponential
   growth or in the stationary phase.
 - araC, the   arabinose operon   regulatory  protein,   which  activates  the
   transcription of the araBAD genes.
 - cafR, the Yersinia pestis F1 operon positive regulatory protein.
 - celD, the Escherichia coli cel operon repressor.

the use  of  a  profile  which  spans  the  minimal  DNA-binding region of 100
residues.

* Crp-type HTH domain signature and profile *
*********************************************

The  crp-type  HTH  domain  is  a  DNA-binding, winged helix-turn-helix (wHTH)
domain  of  about 70-75 amino acids present in transcription regulators of the
crp-fnr  family,  involved  in  the  control  of virulence factors, enzymes of
aromatic  ring  degradation,  nitrogen  fixation,  photosynthesis, and various
types  of  respiration.  The  crp-fnr  family is named after the first members
identified  in  E.coli: the well characterized cyclic AMP receptor protein CRP
or  CAP  (catabolite activator protein) and the fumarate and nitrate reductase
regulator  Fnr.  crp-type  HTH  domain  proteins occur in most bacteria and in
chloroplasts  of  red  algae.  The  DNA-binding  HTH  domain is located in the
C-terminal  part;  the  N-terminal  part of the proteins of the crp-fnr family
contains    a    nucleotide-binding    domain    (see   <PDOC00691>)   and   a
dimerization/linker   helix   occurs   in   between.  The  crp-fnr  regulators
predominantly  act  as  transcription  activators,  but  can also be important
repressors,  and  respond to diverse intracellular and exogenous signals, such
as  cAMP,  anoxia,  redox  state,  oxidative  and  nitrosative  stress, carbon
monoxide, nitric oxide or temperature [1,2].

The  structure  of the crp-type DNA-binding domain (see <PDB:1LB2>) shows that
the  helices (H) forming the helix-turn-helix motif (H2-H3) are flanked by two
beta-hairpin  (B)  wings,  in  the  topology  H1-B1-B2-H2-H3-B3-B4. Helix 3 is
termed  the  recognition helix, as in most wHTHs it binds the DNA major groove
[3,4,5].

Some proteins known to contain a Crp-type HTH domain:

 - Escherichia  coli  crp  (also  known  as  cAMP  receptor),  a  protein that
   complexes   with   cAMP   and   regulates   the  transcription  of  several
   catabolite-sensitive operons.
 - Escherichia  coli fnr, a protein that activates genes for proteins involved
   in a variety of anaerobic electron transport systems.
 - Rhizobium   leguminosarum  fnrN,  a  transcription  regulator  of  nitrogen
   fixation.
 - Rhodobacter  sphaeroides  fnrL, a transcription activator of genes for heme
   biosynthesis,   bacteriochlorophyll   synthesis  and  the  light-harvesting
   complex LHII.
 - Rhizobiacae  fixK,  a  protein that regulates nitrogen fixation genes, both
   positively and negatively.
 - Lactobacillus  casei  fnr-like  protein  flp, a putative regulatory protein
   linked to the trpDCFBA operon.
 - Cyanobacteria  ntcA,  a  regulator  of  the  expression of genes subject to
   nitrogen control.
 - Xanthomonas  campestris  clp,  a  protein  involved  in  the  regulation of
   phytopathogenicity.  Clp  controls the production of extracellular enzymes,
   xanthan gum and pigment, either positively or negatively.

The  'helix-turn-helix'  DNA-binding motif of these proteins is located in the
C-terminal  part  of the sequence. The pattern we use to detect these proteins
starts  two residues before the HTH motif and ends two residues before the end
of helix 3. We also developed a profile that covers the entire wHTH, including
helix 1 and strand 4, and which allows a more sensitive detection.

********************************
* GntR-type HTH domain profile *
********************************

The  gntR-type  HTH  domain  is  a DNA-binding, winged helix-turn-helix (wHTH)
domain  of  about  60-70 residues present in transcriptional regulators of the
gntR  family.  This  family  of  bacterial  regulators is named after Bacillus
subtilis gntR, a repressor of the gluconate operon [1,2]. Six subfamilies have
been  described  for  the gntR family: fadR, hutC, plmA, mocR, ytrA, and araR,
which  regulate various biological processes and important bacterial metabolic
pathways.   The  DNA-binding  gntR-type  HTH  domain  occurs  usually  in  the
N-terminal   part.  The  C-terminal  part  can  contain  a  subfamily-specific
effector-binding  domain  and/or  an  oligomerization  domain.  The  fadR-like
regulators, representing the largest subfamily, are involved in the regulation
of  oxidized  substrates  related to metabolic pathways or metabolism of amino
acids.  HutC-like  proteins  are  involved  in conjugative plasmid transfer in
several  Streptomyces  species.  PlmA is a cyanobacterial regulator of plasmid
maintenance.  The  mocR  subfamily  encompasses proteins homologous to class I
aminotransferase  proteins, which bind pyridoxal phosphate as a cofactor. Most
of  the  ytrA-like  proteins  take  part  in  operons  involved in ATP-binding
cassette  (ABC)  transport  systems.  AraR is an autoregulatory protein with a
C-terminal  domain that binds a carbohydrate effector, similar to that present
in regulators of the lacI/galR family (see <PDOC00366>) [3,4].

The  crystal  structures  of fadR show that the N-terminal, DNA binding domain
contains  a  small  beta-sheet  (B)  core  and  three alpha-helices (H) with a
topology  H1-B1-H2-H3-B2-B3 (see <PDB:1H9T>). Helices 2 and 3, connected via a
tight   turn,   comprise   the   helix-turn-helix   motif.  The  anti-parallel
beta-strands 2 and 3 together with B1 form a small beta-sheet, which is called
the  wing.  Helix  3 is termed the recognition helix as in most wHTHs it binds
the  DNA  major groove. Here, only the N-terminal tip of the recognition helix
makes  specific  DNA-contacts  and  the  wing  makes unusual sequence-specific
contacts  to  the  minor  groove.  Like  other  HTH  proteins,  most gntR-type
regulators  bind as homodimers to 2-fold symmetric DNA sequences in which each
monomer recognizes half of the site [5,6].

Some proteins known to contain a gntR-type HTH domain:

 - Bacillus subtilis gntR, a repressor of the gnt operon, which is responsible
   for  gluconate  metabolism.  In the absence of gluconate, gntR binds to the
   promoter  of  the  operon.  The  expression of the operon is induced in the
   presence of gluconate.
 - Escherichia   coli   fadR,   a  transcriptional  regulator  of  fatty  acid
   metabolism.  In  the  absence of the acyl-CoA effector, fadR binds specific
   operator  sites,  represses  the expression of genes involved in fatty acid
   degradation  and  import,  and  activates  biosynthetic  genes.  Binding of
   acyl-CoA   gives  conformational  changes  abolishing  DNA  binding,  which
   derepresses the catabolic genes and deactivates the anabolic genes.
 - Escherichia   coli  phdR,  a  transcriptional  repressor  of  the  pyruvate
   dehydrogenase complex.
 - Klebsiella   aerogenes  and  Pseudomonas  putida  hutC,  a  transcriptional
   repressor of the histidine utilization (hut) operon.
 - Streptomyces  lividans korA, a  regulator that controls plasmid transfer.
 - Rhizobium meliloti mocR, a probable regulator of rhizopine catabolism.
 - Bacillus  subtilis  ytrA,  a  repressor  of  the  acetoine utilization gene
   cluster.
 - Anabaena  sp.  strain  PCC  7120  plmA,  a  regulator  involved  in plasmid
   maintenance [4].
 - Bacillus  subtilis  araR,  a  transcriptional  repressor  of  the arabinose
   operon.

The  profile  we  developed  covers  the entire gntR-type HTH domain, from the
well-conserved part of helix 1 to the end of the wing.

* LysR-type HTH domain profile *
********************************

The  lysR-type  HTH  domain  is  a DNA-binding, winged helix-turn-helix (wHTH)
domain  of  about  60 residues present in lysR-type transcriptional regulators
(LTTR),  one  of the most common regulator families in prokaryotes. The family
is  named  after  the  Escherichia  coli regulator lysR [1]. LysR proteins are
present in diverse bacterial genera, archaea and algal chloroplasts. All LTTRs
contain  the DNA-binding lysR-type HTH domain, usually in the N-terminal part.
Most  LTTRs  require  a small compound that acts as co-inducer. The C-terminal
part  of  lysR  proteins  can  contain a regulatory domain with two subdomains
involved  in  (1)  co-inducer  recognition/response  and  (2)  DNA binding and
response. LTTRs activate the transcription of operons and regulons involved in
very  diverse  functions,  such  as  amino  acid  biosynthesis,  CO2 fixation,
antibiotic   resistance,  regulation  of  virulence  factors,  nodulation  for
nitrogen  fixing  bacteria,  oxidative  stress  response or aromatic compounds
catabolism.

Most  LTTRs act as a transcriptional activator of the target genes and also as
a repressor of their own expression. Typical LTTRs bind to a sequence of about
50-60  bp,  which  contains two distinct sites, (1) a recognition-binding site
(RBS)  centered  near  -65  of the target transcription start site and with an
inverted   repeat   motif   including   the   T-N(11)-A   motif   and  (2)  an
activation-binding   site   (ABS)   which  overlaps  the  -35  region  of  the
transcription  start  site  of  the  regulated  gene. LysR proteins are mainly
cytoplasmic, but some seem membrane-bound [2].

The crystal structure of the lysR DNA-binding domain of CbnR shows three alpha
helices  and  two  anti-parallel  beta  strands  (see <PDB:1IXC>),   with  the
helix-turn-helix motif comprising the second and third helices and the strands
being called the wing. Most LTTRs are likely tetramers [3].

Some proteins known to contain a lysR domain:

 - Proteus vulgaris blaA, a transcriptional regulator of beta-lactamase.
 - Pseudomonas  putida  catR,  a regulator of catechol catabolism for benzoate
   degradation.
 - Escherichia coli cynR, a regulator for detoxification of cyanate.
 - Klebsiella aerogenes cysB, a regulator of cysteine biosynthesis.
 - Vibrio cholerae irgB, an iron-dependent regulator of virulence factors.
 - Escherichia coli lysR, a transcriptional regulator of lysine biosynthesis.
 - Escherichia coli nhaR, a regulator of a sodium/proton (Na+/H+) antiporter.
 - Rhizobium  meliloti  nodD and syrM, regulators of nodulation genes involved
   in nitrogen fixation symbiosis.
 - Salmonella typhimurium oxyR, a regulator of intracellular hydrogen peroxide
   and oxydative stress response.
 - Ralstonia solanacearum phcA, a regulator of virulence factors.

The profile we developed covers the entire lysR-type HTH domain.

* Bacterial histone-like DNA-binding proteins signature *
*********************************************************

Bacteria  synthesize  a set  of  small,  usually  basic proteins  of  about 90
residues that bind DNA and are known as histone-like proteins [1,2]. The exact
function of  these proteins is not yet clear but they  are capable of wrapping
DNA and   stabilizing   it   from  denaturation  under  extreme  environmental
conditions.  The sequence of a number of different types  of these proteins is
known:

 - The HU proteins, which, in Escherichia coli, are a dimer of closely related
   alpha and  beta  chains  and,  in other bacteria, can be dimer of identical
   chains. HU-type  proteins  have  been  found  in  a  variety of eubacteria,
   cyanobacteria and archaebacteria, and are also encoded  in  the chloroplast
   genome of some algae [3].
 - The integration host factor (IHF), a dimer of  closely related chains which
   seem to  function  in genetic recombination as well as in translational and
   transcriptional control [4] in enterobacteria.
 - The bacteriophage sp01 transcription factor 1 (TF1) which selectively binds
   to and inhibits  the  transcription  of hydroxymethyluracil-containing DNA,
   such as sp01 DNA, by RNA polymerase in vitro.
 - The African Swine fever virus protein A104R (or LMW5-AR) [5].

As a signature pattern for  this family of proteins,  we use a  twenty residue
sequence which includes three perfectly conserved positions.  According to the
tertiary structure  of  one  of these proteins [6], this pattern spans exactly
the first half of the flexible DNA-binding arm.

* Histone H4 signature *
************************

Histone H4  is  one of the  four  histones, along with H2A, H2B  and H3, which
forms the  eukaryotic  nucleosome core. Along with H3, it plays a central role
in nucleosome  formation.  The  sequence  of  histone  H4  has remained almost
invariant in  more then 2 billion years of evolution [1,E1]. The region we use
as a signature pattern is a pentapeptide found in positions 14 to 18 of all H4
sequences.  It  contains a  lysine residue which is often acetylated [2] and a
histidine residue which is implicated in DNA-binding [3].

* Protamine P1 signature *
**************************

Protamines are small, highly  basic  proteins, that substitute for histones in
sperm chromatin  during  the    haploid phase  of  spermatogenesis.  They pack
sperm  DNA into  a   highly  condensed, stable and inactive complex. There are
two different  types  of  mammalian  protamine,  called P1 and P2. P1 has been
found in  all species studied, while P2 is sometimes absent. There seems to be
a single  type of avian protamine whose sequence is closely related to that of
mammalian P1 [1].

As a signature  for this family of proteins, we selected a conserved region at
the N-terminal extremity of the sequence.

* Zinc-containing alcohol dehydrogenases signatures *
*****************************************************

Alcohol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.1) (ADH) catalyzes the reversible oxidation of
ethanol to acetaldehyde with the concomitant  reduction of NAD [1].  Currently
three,   structurally   and   catalytically,   different  types   of   alcohol
dehydrogenases are known:

 - Zinc-containing 'long-chain' alcohol dehydrogenases.
 - Insect-type, or 'short-chain' alcohol dehydrogenases.
 - Iron-containing alcohol dehydrogenases.

Zinc-containing ADH's [2,3] are  dimeric or  tetrameric enzymes  that bind two
atoms of zinc per subunit.  One  of  the  zinc atom is essential for catalytic
activity while the other is not.   Both  zinc atoms  are coordinated by either
cysteine or histidine residues;  the  catalytic zinc  is  coordinated  by  two
cysteines  and one histidine.   Zinc-containing ADH's  are  found in bacteria,
mammals, plants, and in fungi. In most species there are more than one isozyme
(for example,  human  have  at  least six isozymes, yeast have three, etc.). A
number of  other   zinc-dependent dehydrogenases  are  closely related to zinc
ADH [4], these are:

 - Xylitol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.9) (D-xylulose reductase).
 - Sorbitol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.14).
 - Aryl-alcohol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.90) (benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase).
 - L-threonine 3-dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.103).
 - Cinnamyl-alcohol  dehydrogenase  (EC  1.1.1.195)  (CAD) [5]. CAD is a plant
   enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of lignin.

The pattern that  we developed to  detect this  class of enzymes is based on a
conserved region that includes a histidine  residue which is the second ligand
of the catalytic zinc atom.

This family also includes NADP-dependent quinone  oxidoreductase (EC 1.6.5.5),
an enzyme found in bacteria (gene qor), in yeast and in mammals where, in some
species such as rodents, it has  been  recruited as an eye lens protein and is
known as  zeta-crystallin  [7].  The  sequence  of  quinone  oxidoreductase is
distantly related to that other zinc-containing alcohol  dehydrogenases and it
lacks the zinc-ligand residues. The torpedo fish and mammlian synaptic vesicle
membrane protein vat-1 is realted to qor. We have developed a specific pattern
for this subfamily.

* Iron-containing alcohol dehydrogenases signatures *
*****************************************************

Alcohol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.1) (ADH) catalyzes the reversible oxidation of
ethanol to acetaldehyde with the concomitant  reduction of NAD [1].  Currently
three,   structurally   and   catalytically,   different  types   of   alcohol
dehydrogenases are known:

 - Zinc-containing 'long-chain' alcohol dehydrogenases.
 - Insect-type, or 'short-chain' alcohol dehydrogenases.
 - Iron-containing alcohol dehydrogenases.

Iron-containing ADH's have been found in  yeast (gene ADH4) [2], as well as in
Zymomonas mobilis (gene adhB) [3]. These two iron-containing ADH's are closely
related to the following enzymes:

 - Escherichia coli propanediol oxidoreductase (EC 1.1.1.77)  (gene fucO) [4],
   an enzyme involved  in the metabolism of  fucose and  which  also  seems to
   contain ferrous ion(s).
 - Clostridium acetobutylicum NADPH- and NADH-dependent butanol dehydrogenases
   (EC 1.1.1.-) (genes adh1, bdhA and bdhB) [5], an enzyme which has  activity
   using butanol and ethanol as substrates.
 - Escherichia coli adhE [6], an   iron-dependent enzyme  which  harbor  three
   different activities:  alcohol  dehydrogenase,  acetaldehyde  dehydrogenase
   (acetylating) (EC 1.2.1.10) and pyruvate-formate-lyase deactivase.
 - Bacterial glycerol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.6) (gene gldA or dhaD) [7].
 - Clostridium kluyveri NAD-dependent  4-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase  (4hbd)
   (EC 1.1.1.61).
 - Citrobacter    freundii    and    Klebsiella   pneumoniae   1,3-propanediol
   dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.202) (gene dhaT).
 - Bacillus  methanolicus  NAD-dependent methanol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.244)
   [8].
 - Escherichia   coli  and  Salmonella  typhimurium  ethanolamine  utilization
   protein eutG.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yiaY.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein ybdH.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yqhD.
 - Methanococcus jannaschii hypothetical protein MJ0712.

The patterns that  we developed to  detect this  class of enzymes are based on
two conserved regions.

-Consensus pattern: [STALIV]-[LIVF]-x-[DE]-x(6,7)-P-x(4)-[ALIV]-x-[GST]-x(2)-

 - Aldehyde reductase (EC 1.1.1.2).
 - Aldose reductase (EC 1.1.1.21).
 - 3-alpha-hydroxysteroid   dehydrogenase   (EC  1.1.1.50),  which  terminates
   androgen  action  by  converting  5-alpha-dihydrotestosterone  to  3-alpha-
   androstanediol.

* L-lactate dehydrogenase active site *
***************************************

L-lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27) (LDH) [1]  catalyzes the reversible NAD-
dependent interconversion of pyruvate to L-lactate.  In vertebrate muscles and
in lactic  acid bacteria it represents the final step in anaerobic glycolysis.
This tetrameric enzyme is present in prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms.  In
vertebrates there  are  three  isozymes  of  LDH:  the  M  form (LDH-A), found
predominantly in muscle tissues; the H form (LDH-B), found in heart muscle and
the X  form  (LDH-C),  found  only in the spermatozoa of mammals and birds. In
birds and  crocodilian eye lenses, LDH-B serves as a structural protein and is
known as epsilon-crystallin [2].

L-2-hydroxyisocaproate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.-) (L-hicDH) [3]  catalyzes the
reversible and stereospecific  interconversion  between 2-ketocarboxylic acids
and L-2-hydroxy-carboxylic acids. L-hicDH is evolutionary related to LDH's.

As a signature for LDH's we have  selected  a region that includes a conserved
histidine which is essential to the catalytic mechanism.

* Hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase signatures and profile *
*********************************************************************

Hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase  (EC 1.1.1.34)  (HMG-CoA reductase)
[1,2] catalyzes the NADP-dependent  synthesis  of mevalonate from 3-hydroxy-3-
methylglutaryl-CoA.   In vertebrates, HMG-CoA  reductase  is the rate-limiting
enzyme in  cholesterol biosynthesis. In plants, mevalonate is the precursor of
all isoprenoid compounds.

HMG-CoA reductase  is a membrane bound enzyme.  Structurally, it consists of 3
domains. An N-terminal region that contains a variable number of transmembrane
segments (7 in mammals, insects and fungi; 2 in plants), a linker region and a
C-terminal catalytic domain of approximately 400 amino-acid residues.

In archebacteria  [3] HMG-CoA reductase, which is involved in the biosynthesis
of the isoprenoids side chains of lipids, seems to be cytoplasmic and lack the
N-terminal hydrophobic domain.

Some bacteria, such  as Pseudomonas mevalonii, can  use mevalonate as the sole
carbon source.   These   bacteria   use  an  NAD-dependent  HMG-CoA  reductase
(EC 1.1.1.88)  to  deacetylate  mevalonate into 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA
[3]. The Pseudomonas enzyme is structurally  related  to  the catalytic domain
of NADP-dependent HMG-CoA reductases.

We selected   three  conserved  regions  as  signature  patterns  for  HMG-CoA
reductases. The  first  is  located in the center of the catalytic domain, the
second is  a glycine-rich region located in the C-terminal section of the same
catalytic domain  and  the third is also located in the C-terminal section and
contains an histidine residue that seems [4] to be implicated in the catalytic
mechanism as a general base.

* 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase signature *
*********************************************

3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.35) (HCDH) [1] is an enzyme involved
in fatty acid metabolism,  it catalyzes the reduction  of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA to
3-oxoacyl-CoA. Most eukaryotic cells have 2 fatty-acid beta-oxidation systems,
one located in  mitochondria and  the  other in peroxisomes.   In  peroxisomes
3-hydroxyacyl-CoA  dehydrogenase  forms,  with  enoyl-CoA  hydratase (ECH) and
3,2-trans-enoyl-CoA isomerase (ECI)  a  multifunctional  enzyme  where  the N-
terminal domain bears the hydratase/isomerase  activities  and  the C-terminal
domain the  dehydrogenase  activity.  There are two mitochondrial enzymes: one
which is   monofunctional   and  the  other  which is,  like  its  peroxisomal
counterpart, multifunctional.

In Escherichia coli (gene fadB) and Pseudomonas fragi (gene faoA) HCDH is part
of a multifunctional enzyme which also contains an ECH/ECI domain as well as a
3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA epimerase domain [2].

The other proteins structurally related to HCDH are:

 - Bacterial  3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA  dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.157) which reduces
   3-hydroxybutanoyl-CoA to acetoacetyl-CoA [3].
 - Eye  lens  protein  lambda-crystallin [4], which is specific to lagomorphes
   (such as rabbit).

There are two major region of similarities in the sequences of proteins of the
HCDH family, the  first one located in the N-terminal, corresponds to the NAD-
binding site, the second one is located in the center of the sequence. We have
chosen to derive a signature pattern from this central region.

* Malate dehydrogenase active site signature *
**********************************************

Malate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.37) (MDH)  [1,2] catalyzes  the interconversion
of malate to  oxaloacetate utilizing the NAD/NADH  cofactor system. The enzyme
participates in the citric acid cycle and exists in all aerobics organisms.

While prokaryotic organisms contains a single form of MDH, in eukaryotic cells
there are  two  isozymes: one which is located in the mitochondrial matrix and
the other in the cytoplasm.  Fungi  and  plants also harbor a glyoxysomal form
which  functions in the glyoxylate pathway. In plants chloroplast there is an
additional  NADP-dependent form of  MDH (EC 1.1.1.82)  which  is essential for
both the universal  C3 photosynthesis (Calvin)  cycle and the more specialized
C4 cycle.

As a signature pattern  for  this enzyme we have chosen a region that includes
two residues  involved in the catalytic mechanism [3]:  an aspartic acid which
is involved  in a  proton relay  mechanism,  and  an  arginine which binds the
substrate.

* Aldehyde dehydrogenases active sites *
****************************************

Aldehyde dehydrogenases (EC 1.2.1.3 and EC 1.2.1.5)  are enzymes which oxidize
a wide variety of aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes.  In mammals at least  four
different forms  of  the enzyme are known [1]: class-1 (or Ald C) a tetrameric
cytosolic enzyme, class-2 (or Ald M) a tetrameric mitochondrial enzyme, class-
3 (or Ald D) a dimeric  cytosolic  enzyme,  and  class IV a microsomal enzyme.
Aldehyde  dehydrogenases  have  also  been sequenced from fungal and bacterial
species.  A number of enzymes are known to be evolutionary related to aldehyde
dehydrogenases; these enzymes are listed below.

 - Plants and bacterial  betaine-aldehyde  dehydrogenase  (EC 1.2.1.8) [2], an
   enzyme that catalyzes the last step in the biosynthesis of betaine.
 - Plants     and    bacterial    NADP-dependent    glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
   dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.9).
 - Escherichia coli succinate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (NADP+) (EC 1.2.1.16)
   (gene gabD) [3], which reduces succinate semialdehyde into succinate.
 - Escherichia coli lactaldehyde dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.22) (gene ald) [4].
 - Mammalian succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (NAD+) (EC 1.2.1.24).
 - Escherichia coli phenylacetaldehyde dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.39).
 - Escherichia     coli     5-carboxymethyl-2-hydroxymuconate     semialdehyde
   dehydrogenase (gene hpcC).
 - Pseudomonas putida 2-hydroxymuconic  semialdehyde  dehydrogenase [5] (genes
   dmpC and xylG), an enzyme in the meta-cleavage pathway for  the degradation
   of phenols, cresols and catechol.
 - Bacterial and  mammalian  methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (MMSDH)
   (EC 1.2.1.27) [6],  an  enzyme  involved  in  the  distal pathway of valine
   catabolism.
 - Yeast delta-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase (EC 1.5.1.12) [7] (gene
   PUT2), which converts proline to glutamate.
 - Bacterial multifunctional putA protein, which contains a delta-1-pyrroline-
   5-carboxylate dehydrogenase domain.
 - 26G,  a  garden  pea  protein  of  unknown  function  which  is  induced by
   dehydration of shoots [8].
 - Mammalian formyltetrahydrofolate  dehydrogenase (EC 1.5.1.6) [9]. This is a
   cytosolic enzyme   responsible  for   the  NADP-dependent   decarboxylative
   reduction of  10-formyltetrahydrofolate  into  tetrahydrofolate.  It  is an
   protein of about 900 amino  acids  which consist of three  domains;  the C-
   terminal domain (480 residues) is structurally and  functionally related to
   aldehyde dehydrogenases.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YBR006w.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YER073w.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YHR039c.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein F01F1.6.

A glutamic acid and a cysteine residue  have  been implicated in the catalytic
activity of mammalian aldehyde dehydrogenase.  These residues are conserved in
all the enzymes of this family.  We have derived two patterns for this family,
one for each of the active site residues.

* Acyl-CoA dehydrogenases signatures *
**************************************

Acyl-CoA  dehydrogenases [1,2,3] are enzymes  that catalyze  the   alpha,beta-
dehydrogenation of acyl-CoA esters and transfer electrons to ETF, the electron
transfer protein. Acyl-CoA dehydrogenases are FAD flavoproteins. This family
currently includes:

 - Five eukaryotic isozymes that catalyze the first step of the beta-oxidation
   cycles for fatty acids with various chain lengths.  These are  short (SCAD)
   (EC 1.3.99.2),  medium  (MCAD)  (EC  1.3.99.3), long (LCAD) (EC 1.3.99.13),
   very-long (VLCAD) and short/branched (SBCAD) chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenases.
   These enzymes are located in the mitochondrion. They are all homotetrameric
   proteins of  about  400  amino acid residues except VLCAD  which is a dimer
   and which contains, in its mature form, about 600 residues.
 - Glutaryl-CoA  dehydrogenase  (EC 1.3.99.7) (GCDH), which is involved in the
   catabolism of lysine, hydroxylysine and tryptophan.
 - Isovaleryl-CoA   dehydrogenase   (EC  1.3.99.10)  (IVD),  involved  in  the
   catabolism of leucine.
 - Acyl-coA dehydrogenases acdA and mmgC from Bacillus subtilis.
 - Butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (EC 1.3.99.2) from Clostridium acetobutylicum.
 - Escherichia coli protein caiA [4].
 - Escherichia coli protein aidB.

We have  selected  two  conserved  regions as signature patterns. The first is
located in the center of these enzymes, the second in the C-terminal section.

 - Glutamate  dehydrogenases  (EC 1.4.1.2, EC 1.4.1.3, and EC 1.4.1.4) (GluDH)
   are enzymes that catalyze the NAD- or NADP-dependent reversible deamination
   of glutamate into  alpha-ketoglutarate [1,2]. GluDH isozymes are  generally
   involved with either ammonia assimilation or glutamate catabolism.
 - Leucine dehydrogenase (EC 1.4.1.9) (LeuDH) is a  NAD-dependent enzyme  that
   catalyzes the reversible deamination of leucine and several other aliphatic
   amino acids to their keto analogues [3].
 - Phenylalanine dehydrogenase (EC 1.4.1.20) (PheDH) is a NAD-dependent enzyme
   that catalyzes the  reversible deamidation of  L-phenylalanine into phenyl-
   pyruvate [4].
 - Valine  dehydrogenase  (EC 1.4.1.8) (ValDH) is a NADP-dependent enzyme that
   catalyzes the  reversible   deamidation   of   L-valine   into  3-methyl-2-
   oxobutanoate [5].

These  dehydrogenases  are structurally and functionally related.  A conserved
lysine  residue located in a  glycine-rich  region has been  implicated in the
catalytic mechanism. The conservation of the region around this residue allows
the derivation of a signature pattern for such type of enzymes.

***************************************************************
* Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) domain signature and profile *
***************************************************************

Dihydrofolate reductases (DHFRs) (EC 1.5.1.3) [1] are ubiquitous enzymes which
catalyze the   NADPH-linked   reduction   of   7,8-dihydrofolate  to  5,6,7,8-
tetrahydrofolate. DHFRs  are  also  capable  of  catalyzing  the  NADPH-linked
reduction of  folate  to 7,8-dihydrofolate, but at a lesser rate, which varies
among species.  They  can  be  inhibited  by  a  number of antagonists such as
trimethroprim and   methotrexate   which   are   used   as   antibacterial  or
anticancerous agents.

Thymidylate synthase  (TS)  (see  <PDOC00086>)  and  DHFR  catalyze sequential
reactions in  the  thymidylate  cycle, which supplies cells with their sole de
novo source  of  2'-deoxythymidylate  (dTMP) for DNA synthesis. TS catalyzes a
reductive methylation  of  2'deoxyuridylate  (dUMP)  to form dTMP in which the
cofactor for  the  reaction,  5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate  is  converted to
dihydrofolate (FH(2)).  DHFR then reduces FH(2) to tetrahydrofolate (FH(4)) in
a reaction   requiring   NADPH.   In  sources  as  diverse  as  bacteriophage,
prokaryotes, fungi,  mammalian  viruses,  and  vertebrates,  TS  and  DHFR are
distinct monofunctional enzymes. Protozoa and at least some plants are unusual
in having  a  joined  bifunctional  polypetide  that  catalyzes both reactions
[2,3].

An eight-stranded  beta  sheet  consisting  of  seven  parallel  strands and a
carboxy-terminal antiparallel strand composes the core of the DHFR domain. The
beta-sheet core is flanked by alpha-helices (see <PDB:1DRH>) [2-6].

We have  derived  a  signature pattern from a region in the N-terminal part of
the DHFR  domain, which includes a conserved Pro-Trp dipeptide; the tryptophan
has been  shown  [7] to be involved in the binding of substrate by the enzyme.
We have also developed a profile, which covers the entire DHFR domain.

* Cytochrome c oxidase subunit I signature and profile *
********************************************************

Cytochrome  c  oxidase  (EC  1.9.3.1)  [1]  is an oligomeric integral membrane
protein  complexes  that  catalyze the terminal step in the respiratory chain:
they transfer electrons from cytochrome c or a quinol to oxygen. Some terminal
oxidases  generate  a transmembrane proton gradient across the plasma membrane
(prokaryotes)  or  the  mitochondrial  inner membrane (eukaryotes). The enzyme
complex consists of 3-4 subunits (prokaryotes) up to 13 polypeptides (mammals)
of which only the catalytic subunit (equivalent to mammalian subunit 1 (CO I))
is found in all heme-copper respiratory oxidases. The presence of a bimetallic
center,  formed  by  a  high-spin  heme  (heme  a3) and copper B, as well as a
low-spin  heme (heme a), both ligated to six conserved histidine residues near
the outer side of four transmembrane spans within CO I is common to all family
members [2-4].

In contrary to  eukaryotes the respiratory chain of prokaryotes is branched to
multiple terminal  oxidases.  The  enzyme  complexes  vary  in heme and copper
composition, substrate  type and substrate affinity. The different respiratory
oxidases  allow  the cells to customize their  respiratory systems according a
variety of environmental growth conditions [1].

The  crystal  structure  of  the  whole  enzyme complexe have been solved [5].
Subunit I contains 12 transmembrane helical segments and binds heme a and heme
a3-copper  B binuclear centre where molecular oxygen is reduced to water. (see
<PDB:1OCZ; A>).

Recently also  a component of an anaerobic respiratory chain has been found to
contain  the copper B binding signature of this family: nitric oxide reductase
(NOR) exists in denitrifying species of Archae and Eubacteria.

Enzymes that belong to this family are:

 - Mitochondrial-type cytochrome c oxidase (EC  1.9.3.1) which uses cytochrome
   c as electron donor. The electrons are transferred via copper A (Cu(A)) and
   heme a  to  the  bimetallic  center  of  CO  I  that  is formed by a penta-
   coordinated heme   a     and  copper  B  (Cu(B)).  Subunit  1  contains  12
   transmembrane regions.  Cu(B)  is  said  to  be  ligated  to  three  of the
   conserved histidine  residues  within  the  transmembrane segments 6 and 7.
 - Quinol oxidase  from prokaryotes  that transfers electrons from a quinol to
   the binuclear  center  of  polypeptide I. This category of enzymes includes
   Escherichia coli cytochrome O terminal oxidase complex which is a component
   of the  aerobic respiratory chain that predominates when cells are grown at
   high aeration.
 - FixN,  the  catalytic  subunit  of  a  cytochrome  c  oxidase  expressed in
   nitrogen-fixing bacteroids  living  in  root nodules. The high affinity for
   oxygen allows oxidative phosphorylation under low  oxygen concentrations. A
   similar enzyme has been found in other purple bacteria.
 - Nitric oxide reductase (EC 1.7.99.7) from Pseudomonas stutzeri. NOR reduces
   nitrate to  dinitrogen.  It  is  a  heterodimer  of  norC and the catalytic
   subunit norB. The latter contains the 6 invariant histidine residues and 12
   transmembrane segments [6].

As  a signature pattern we used the copper-binding region. We also developed a
profile that cover the whole subunit I.

* Cytochrome c oxidase subunit II signature and profiles *
**********************************************************

Cytochrome  c  oxidase  (EC  1.9.3.1) [1,2] is an oligomeric enzymatic complex
which  is a component of the respiratory chain and is involved in the transfer
of electrons from cytochrome c to oxygen. In eukaryotes this enzyme complex is
located  in  the  mitochondrial  inner  membrane; in aerobic prokaryotes it is
found  in  the  plasma  membrane.  The enzyme complex consists of 3-4 subunits
(prokaryotes) to up to 13 polypeptides (mammals).

Subunit  2  (CO II) transfers the electrons from cytochrome c to the catalytic
subunit  1.  It  contains two adjacent transmembrane regions in its N-terminus
and  the  major  part  of  the protein is exposed to the periplasmic or to the
mitochondrial intermembrane space, respectively. CO II provides the substrate-
binding  site  and  contains  a  copper  center  called  Cu(A), located in the
extramembrane  domain  (see  <PDB:1OCZ;  B>), probably the primary acceptor in
cytochrome  c  oxidase.  An  exception  is  the  corresponding  subunit of the
cbb3-type  oxidase which lacks the copper A redox-center. Several bacterial CO
II have a C-terminal extension that contains a covalently bound heme c.

It has been shown [3,4] that nitrous oxide reductase (EC 1.7.99.6) (gene nosZ)
of Pseudomonas has sequence similarity in its C-terminus to CO II. This enzyme
is part of the bacterial respiratory system which is activated under anaerobic
conditions in  the presence of nitrate or nitrous oxide. NosZ is a periplasmic
homodimer that  contains  a  dinuclear copper center, probably located in a 3-
dimensional fold  similar  to the cupredoxin-like fold that has been suggested
for the copper-binding site of CO II [3].

The  dinuclear  purple copper center is formed by 2 histidines and 2 cysteines
[5].  We used this region as a signature pattern. The conserved valine and the
conserved methionine are said to be involved in stabilizing the copper-binding
fold  by  interacting  with  each  other.  We also developed two profiles, one
directed against the transmembrane region and one against the copper center.

* Multicopper oxidases signatures *
***********************************

Multicopper oxidases [1,2] are enzymes  that possess  three  spectroscopically
different copper centers. These centers are called: type  1 (or  blue), type 2
(or  normal)  and type 3 (or  coupled binuclear).  The  enzymes that belong to
this family are:

 - Laccase (EC 1.10.3.2)  (urishiol oxidase), an enzyme  found  in  fungi  and
   plants, which oxidizes many different types of phenols and diamines.
 - L-ascorbate oxidase (EC 1.10.3.3), a higher plant enzyme.
 - Ceruloplasmin (EC 1.16.3.1) (ferroxidase), a protein  found in the serum of
   mammals and birds, which  oxidizes a great variety of inorganic and organic
   substances. Structurally ceruloplasmin exhibits internal sequence homology,
   and seem to  have  evolved from the triplication of a copper-binding domain
   similar to that found in laccase and ascorbate oxidase.

In addition to the above enzymes there are  a number of proteins which, on the
basis of sequence similarities, can  be said to belong to this  family.  These
proteins are:

 - Copper resistance protein A (copA)  from a plasmid in Pseudomonas syringae.
   This protein seems to  be involved in  the resistance of the microbial host
   to copper.
 - Blood coagulation factor V (Fa V).
 - Blood coagulation factor VIII (Fa VIII) [E1].
 - Yeast FET3 [3], which is required for ferrous iron uptake.
 - Yeast  hypothetical  protein  YFL041w  and  SpAC1F7.08,  the  fission yeast
   homolog.

Factors V and VIII act as cofactors in blood coagulation  and are structurally
similar [4]. Their sequence consists of a triplicated A domain, a B domain and
a duplicated C domain;  in the following order: A-A-B-A-C-C. The A-type domain
is related to the multicopper oxidases.

We have developed two signature patterns for these proteins. Both patterns are
derived  from the  same  region, which  in  ascorbate oxidase, laccase, in the
third domain of  ceruloplasmin,  and in copA,  contains five residues that are
known to be involved in the binding of copper centers.  The first pattern does
not make any assumption  on  the  presence of copper-binding residues and thus
can detect domains that have lost the ability to bind copper (such as those in
Fa V and Fa VIII),  while  the  second  pattern  is specific to copper-binding
domains.

-Consensus pattern: G-x-[FYW]-x-[LIVMFYW]-x-[CST]-x-{PR}-{K}-x(2)-{S}-x-{LFH}-
                    G-[LM]-x(3)-[LIVMFYW]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for Emericella nidulans laccase.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 33 other proteins and  Thiobacillus
 ferrooxidans rusticyanin which is  also  a copper-binding protein,  but which
 belong to the type-1 copper proteins family (see <PDOC00174>).

-Consensus pattern: H-C-H-x(3)-H-x(3)-[AG]-[LM]
                    [The first 2 H's are copper type 3 binding residues]
                    [The C, the third H, and L or M are copper type 1 ligands]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: only domains
 that bind copper.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Last update: April 2006 / Pattern revised.

* Lipoxygenase iron-binding catalytic domain signatures and profile *
*********************************************************************

Lipoxygenases (EC 1.13.11.-) are a class of iron-containing dioxygenases which
catalyzes   the   hydroperoxidation   of  lipids,  containing  a  cis,cis-1,4-
pentadiene  structure. The primary products are hydroperoxy fatty acids, which
usually  are  rapidly reduced to hydroxy derivatives. Lipoxygenases are common
in  plants  where they may be involved in a number of diverse aspects of plant
physiology  including  growth and development, pest resistance, and senescence
or  responses  to  wounding [1]. In mammals a number of lipoxygenases isozymes
are  involved  in  the  metabolism  of  prostaglandins  and  leukotrienes [2].
Lipoxygenases are also common in primitive animals such as coral [3] and occur
in  some  bacteria  [4,5]. The N-terminal part of the eukaryotic lipoxygenases
contains   a   PLAT   domain   (see  <PDOC50095>)  that  may  be  involved  in
membrane-binding  or  substrate  acquisition, while the iron-binding catalytic
domain forms the C-terminal part.

The  3D structure of the catalytic domain is mainly alpha-helical with an iron
in  the active site (see <PDB:1F8N>). The center of the domain consists of two
long  helices, which contain four of the iron-binding residues (at least three
of  which  are  histidines).  A  fifth  residue  that coordinates the non-heme
catalytic  iron is the carboxylate of the C-terminal isoleucine. The mammalian
catalytic  domain  has a length of ~550-600 residues, which is shorter than in
the  plant  lipoxygenases and forms a more compact structure as the additional
100-150 amino acids in plant enzymes form extra loops [3,6,7].

Some proteins known to contain a lipoxygenase iron-binding catalytic domain:

 - Plant lipoxygenases (EC 1.13.11.12). Plants express a variety  of cytosolic
   isozymes as well as what seems [8] to be a chloroplast isozyme.
 - Mammalian arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (EC 1.13.11.34).
 - Mammalian arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase (EC 1.13.11.31).
 - Mammalian erythroid cell-specific 15-lipoxygenase (EC 1.13.11.33).
 - Coral  (Plexaura  homomalla)  allene oxide synthase-lipoxygenase protein, a
   bifunctional   enzyme   including   both   a  peroxidase  and  arachidonate
   8-lipoxygenase (EC 1.13.11.40).
 - Pseudomonas   aeruginosa   oleic   acid   lipoxygenase   and   arachidonate
   15-lipoxygenase (EC 1.13.11.33).

Six  histidines are strongly conserved in lipoxygenase sequences, five of them
are  found  clustered in a stretch of 40 amino acids. This region contains two
of  the  three  iron-ligands;  the  other histidines have been shown [9] to be
important  for the activity of lipoxygenases. As signatures for this family of
enzymes  we have selected two patterns in the region of the histidine cluster.
The first pattern contains the first three conserved histidines and the second
pattern  includes  the  fourth and the fifth. We also developed a profile that
covers the entire lipoxygenase iron-binding catalytic domain.
